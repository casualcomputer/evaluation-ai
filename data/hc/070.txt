Executive Summary
The evaluation of the Contribution to Brain Canada  Foundation’s Canada Brain Research Fund (CBRF) was undertaken in fulfillment of  the requirements of the Financial Administration Act. 
Evaluation Purpose and Scope
The purpose of the  evaluation was to assess the relevance and performance of the contribution to  the Brain Canada Foundation’s CBRF for the period ranging from March 2012 to  March 2016. In addition, the evaluation reviewed the funding model currently in  place.
Program Description
The 2011  federal budget included an allocation of $100 million to support the  establishment of Brain Canada Foundation’s CBRF. This federal commitment was supplemented by an additional $20 million  which was announced in Budget 2016. To access the full $120 million, Brain  Canada Foundation (BCF) must raise the equivalent amount through non-federal  donation sources in order to trigger a 1:1 match by Health Canada. 
The objective of CBRF is to accelerate discoveries by supporting research that advances knowledge  of the brain and promises development in the diagnosis of, and therapies  associated with brain conditions. Funding supports  the full spectrum of brain and mental health research, with a focus on higher  risk projects through innovative collaborations that are conducted with the  hopes of producing higher rewards. Research funding is provided through three  mechanisms: the Multi-Investigator Research Initiatives (MIRIs); Platform  Support Grants (PSGs); and training awards.
The MIRIs support  multidisciplinary teams and aim to accelerate novel and transformative research  that will change the understanding of nervous system function and dysfunction.
The PSGs are intended to facilitate and  accelerate research by funding the maintenance and operation of major existing research  platforms, providing national or regional technical capability to multiple  neuroscience investigators.
To promote the next  generation of researchers, the training awards are granted to outstanding  doctoral students and postdoctoral fellows undertaking original research related  to the origins and consequences of brain diseases and conditions.
Conclusions - Relevance
Neurological conditions  have been estimated to affect approximately 3.6 million Canadians and are the  most costly of health conditions when accounting for combined direct and  indirect costs. The number of individuals living with  neurological conditions and the cost of associated care are expected to rise as  the Canadian population ages. 
The brain has been cited as the last frontier  of health research. Key informants and document  review sources confirm that there is a continued need for research to better  understand how the brain functions. Not-for-profit organizations specific to  health research involving the brain have been created in disease-specific silos  (e.g., the Alzheimer’s Society, the MS Society), and as a result there have  been limitations in the linking of findings across diseases impacting the  brain. A whole-of-brain approach to research in this field is expected to help  identify similar degenerative pathways linked to  a variety of neurological diseases. 
A focus on neuroscience research is consistent with  departmental priorities and has been outlined as a federal priority throughout  the period captured in this evaluation. The CBRF’s innovative approach in  working towards generating discoveries contributes to current federal science  priorities. Although some overlap exists, for the most part, key informants  agreed that the work of CIHR and CBRF are more complementary than duplicative. 
Conclusions - Performance
While it is still too early to assess the long-term outcomes  resulting from the CBRF, it is evident that MIRI grants and PSGs facilitate collaboration  within the brain community and across disciplines. This collaborative and  multidisciplinary approach is seen as promising in researching common  mechanisms presenting across neurological and psychiatric diseases. Currently,  the portfolio of projects funded appear to be well balanced in terms of  translational, pre-clinical and clinical research.
An assessment of intermediate outcome impacts would be more  appropriate once the intended outcome timeframe of 7-15 years has passed. At  this point in time, anecdotal evidence suggests that some projects demonstrate  potential for downstream impacts, including new discoveries and the use of new  therapies, interventions, diagnostics, tools and products stemming from CBRF  research discoveries.
To  date, CBRF’s private-public funding partnership model has facilitated the  incorporation of new sources of funding within the research field that are typically  not engaged by federally funded research organizations. However, the operationalization  of the funding model  could be improved by moving away from requiring donations be transferred to the  CBRF and verified through audited financial statements in order to receive the  matched federal funding. A shift to a less onerous approach has the potential  to better support the objective of the CBRF and build on BCF’s capacity to  maintain relationships with partners interested in increasing overall  investments in brain research. Mechanisms are in place to  continually assess projects’ progress and their use of funds. In terms of  administrative efficiencies, the  letter of intent (LOI) peer review process for CBRF has served to streamline the  application and project selection processes.
Recommendation
Health Canada should consider  adjusting the CBRF Funding Model. 
While the CBRF funding model has clearly resulted in  increased funds being dedicated to brain research in Canada, it still faces  challenges including:

Capturing administrative costs associated with  the management of all funding and its impact on funding available for matching. 
Requirement of audited financial statements  prior to initiating federal funding match which results in delays to spending  matched funding. 
Operationalization of the flow-through funding  model that includes requirements to physically transfer funds to BCF’s account  in order to trigger a federal funding match has impacted the ability of  not-for-profits and provinces to donate money. Not-for-profits do not typically  transfer funds to intermediaries due to lack of control of disbursement of  donated funds, and provincial funders require funding to stay within the  province. 

To address these challenges Health Canada should continue  its examination of the funding model and make necessary adjustments that ensure  it meets the needs of both BCF and Health Canada.

1.0 Evaluation Purpose
The purpose of the  evaluation was to assess the relevance, achievement of outcomes, as well as the  economy and efficiency of the CBRF, which was partially established through a  federal contribution. The scope of the evaluation includes CBRF activities  during the period of 2011-2012 to 2015-2016. This evaluation also examined the  funding model developed for the Fund.
This was a scheduled evaluation as per the Public Health Agency of  Canada/Health Canada Five-Year Evaluation Plan 2015-2016 to 2019-2020, in accordance  with the requirements outlined  in the Financial Administration Act. 
2.0 Program  Description
2.1 Program Context
In Budget 2011, the Government of Canada announced the  establishment of the CBRF, which was formalized in 2012 when Health Canada entered into a contribution  agreement with the BCF. Through this Agreement, currently managed by Health Canada’s Strategic Policy Branch (SPB), the  federal government initially committed up to $100 million to fund the BCF’s CBRF. It was later supplemented  with an additional $20 million through the 2016 federal budget. Access to the  full amount of federal funding is determined by BCF’s ability to raise  equivalent funds from non-federal governmental sources, based on a 1:1 matching  model.
The initial contribution agreement was amended in  July 2015, updating the contribution agreement’s end date to March 31, 2020.  This extension was sought to allow for the matching of private funds raised  towards the end of the original cycle.
BCF, a  registered charity first established as NeuroScience Canada in 1998, manages  the CBRF. Between 2003 and 2011, the organization operated without funding from  the Government of Canada, relying mostly on philanthropy. NeuroScience Canada/  BCF recognized an underfunding of neuroresearch. BCF advocated for focusing research  activities on better understanding the functioning of the brain as a whole, believing  it would likely lead to a greater understanding of common mechanisms across  various conditions and diseases affecting the brain. 
2.2 Program  Profile
Acting as a focal point for non-federal  investments in brain research, the objective of CBRF activities is to accelerate discoveries by  supporting research that advances knowledge of the brain and promises  development in the diagnosis of, and therapies aimed at, improving the health  and quality of life for Canadians who suffer from brain disorders. CBRF funding  supports the full spectrum of  brain and mental health research. Funding is primarily intended to support  higher risk projects conducted through innovative collaborations between  relevant disciplines including physical science, applied and social sciences1. Research funding is  provided through three distinct mechanisms: Multi-Investigator Research  Initiatives (MIRI), PSG and training awards. During the years covered by the evaluation, the BCF launched  24 calls for proposals within these funding mechanisms. Figure 1  outlines the percentage of funds committed according to the CBRF funding  mechanism category. 
Figure 1: CBRF funding commitments according to funding mechanism  category




Figure 1 - Long Description
This figure depicts a pie graph outlining the percentage of funds committed according to the CBRF funding mechanism category. The graph shows that as of December 2015, 74% of CBRF funding committed was for Multi-Investigator Research Initiatives (MIRI) projects, while 24% was for Platform Support Grants (PSG) with the remaining 2% for training awards. 



1. Multi-Investigator  Research Initiatives 
MIRI supports multidisciplinary teams  and aims to accelerate novel and transformative research that will  fundamentally change the understanding of nervous system function and  dysfunction and its impact on health.2
Seventeen  calls for proposals were associated with the MIRI mechanism, dating back to 2012.  Proposals  can address any aspect of nervous system function or dysfunction that has  relevance to neurological and/or psychiatric diseases and conditions, including  those of the special sensesFootnote i and the peripheral nervous  system. The focus of proposals must be on investigating commonalities among  multiple or related neurological and/or psychiatric conditions. Applicants’  proposals are assessed by an international review committee made-up of scientists,  clinicians, and researchers from various fields. They assess the strength of  proposals by benchmarking them against global standards of excellence and  innovation, while considering the proposed project’s likelihood of producing novel  and transformative nervous system function and dysfunction research findings. The  MIRI calls for proposals yielded 82 projects,Footnote ii,3 of  which five concluded in 2015. The remaining project completion dates fall  outside of the evaluation period: 61 research projects will conclude between  2016-18, and the remaining 16 will finish in 2019-20. Total grants awarded within this  category varied from $100,000 to $9,996,0874 per project, with most exceeding $1  million. To date, $115,403,973 has been  committed to  MIRI projects, accounting for 74% of CBRF funding committedFootnote iii (as of December  2015). During the 2011-15 period, $35,335,3805 was  disbursed to fund MIRI projects.
2. Platform Support  Grants
PSGs are intended to  facilitate and accelerate research by filling a funding gap for operations and  maintenance of major research platforms providing national or regional  technical capability to multiple neuroscience investigators. PSGs are not  intended to replace current sources of funding. Examples of PSGs could include  brain banks, imaging facilities, data repositories and data-sharing systems. 
Three calls for proposals took place under the PSG stream, with  the first call launched in 2014. All three calls yielded a total of 22  platforms. These projects, which are all still in progress, accounted for 24%  ($37,353,711) of funding  committed up until December 2015.  The PSG award values varied from $138,750 to $6,105,000. One project received  their funding in 2014, 19 in 2015, and an additional two in 2016. A  total of $5,063,8406 was disbursed for PSGs during the 2011-2015 period. 
3. Training Awards 
Training Awards enable the next generation of young researchers to  receive high-quality training under the direction of leading Canadian  researchers. The awards are granted to outstanding doctoral students and  postdoctoral fellows undertaking a program of research training that  incorporates original research exploring the origins and consequences of  neurological and/or psychiatric diseases and conditions. 
Four calls for proposals took place under the Training Award  mechanism yielding 34 awardsFootnote iv, of  which 10 concluded in 2015, 22 will conclude in 2016/2017, and an additional  two in 2019/2020. Less than three percent ($3,947,500) of the funding committed up until December  2015 was allocated to 34 training awards. The award value for students and fellows  varied from $5,000 to $195,000. During the 2011-15 period, a  total of $1,584,058 was disbursed for Training Awards. 
Types of Funding Competitions
CBRF offers two  different types of funding competitions: sponsored and partnered. Sponsored competitions are developed by the  Foundation, whereas Partnered Initiatives are developed in partnership with  donors. 
All competitions  begin as ‘open calls’, meaning scientists in any field of study can submit an  application if their research matches the eligibility criteria particular to  that competition.7 Applications are assessed  primarily on the basis of their scientific merit and innovation potential,  although other criteria such as feasibility can be used depending on the  program. Applications are also screened for potential short and long-term  impacts, meaning research that can change fundamental understandings of the  brain and nervous system.
Governance 
BCF, which is  responsible for the administration of the CBRF, is governed by a board of  elected directors responsible for supervising the management of the activities  and affairs of the Foundation. The Board of Directors is currently comprised of  16 members with nine honourary members8.  While the mandate of the Board is broad, members’ key responsibilities are to:  advance the interests of stakeholders and the overall organization; review  recommendations of the Research Policy Committee (RPC) with respect to BCF’s  areas of science focus and priority; as well as assist with fundraising and maintaining  relationships with key program and funding partners, including government and  voluntary health organizations.9
The RPC10 is  a committee of the BCF board which can include members from the Canadian  philanthropist community, corporate executives and scientists. They offer  advice and perspectives to the Board of Directors at large on the research funded  through the CBRF. More specifically, the RPC advises the Board on matters such  as the goals of the research funding programs and progress towards the  achievement of those goals; the competition and review processes; post-award  reporting; and approval of ongoing funding. 
The RPC is also responsible  for making recommendations to the Board to seek input from the Science Advisory  Council (SAC) on emerging scientific issues and opportunities. This Council, which is comprised of 23  members originating primarily from Canada and the United States, provides the RPC  with intelligence about developments in the field, within Canada and  internationally, and provides a broad assessment of the CBRF’s research programs.  Activities of the SAC enable the RPC to assess whether  changes to the program should be made in order to ensure that it is  appropriately flexible and responsive to the science. They also monitor the  achievement of the intended outcomes and impacts11.
Other internal  committees reporting to the Board and guiding BCF operations include:

The Audit, Finance and Investment    Committee responsible for reviewing financial statements and recommending    approvals to the Board;
The Governance, Nominating and Ethics    Committee provides oversight in matters related to governance, nomination    of people to serve as directors and committee members, as well as ensures    the highest ethical standards for all staff; and
The Public Policy and Communications    Committee provides advice/reports on public policy and communications    including positioning, branding and government relations.

The BCF governance  structure was awarded a Conference Board National Award in Governance in  2006.12 Beyond the creation of the SAC in 2013, the  current BCF governance structure remains largely unchanged. This award  celebrates “innovations and best practices in governance in the private, public  and not-for-profit sectors”.13
2.3 Program  Narrative
This is the first  evaluation to examine activities of the CBRF. In consultation with the SPB and  BCF, the existing and detailed logic model developed by the BCF was simplified  to guide the evaluation (Appendix 1). 
Activity areas and  outputs are related to funding and overseeing MIRIs, PSGs and training awards.  The immediate outcomes expected to materialize from these activities are:  increased research collaboration in identified priority areas; increased number  of highly qualified peopleFootnote v in brain disease research;  and increased discoveries related to knowledge of the brain, new therapies, interventions,  diagnostics and products. 
It is expected that  positive results for these immediate outcomes will contribute to a strengthened  brain disease research community; and increased use of new therapies,  interventions, diagnostics and products; to ultimately improve the health and  quality of life for Canadians suffering from and affected by neurological and  psychiatric diseases.
The connection between these activity areas and the expected outcomes  is depicted in the logic model. The evaluation explored the degree to which the  defined outcomes have been achieved over the specified timeframe of the evaluation,  while acknowledging the limitations of performing an assessment at such an  early stage in the Fund’s operation. 
2.4 Program  Alignment and Resources
Through the CBRF,  Health Canada aims to accelerate discoveries focused on improving the health  and quality of life for Canadians living with brain disorders. This is aligned  with Health Canada’s work on Health System Priorities (subprogram 1.1.1) which refers  to “working closely with provincial  and territorial governments, domestic and international organizations, health  care providers, and other stakeholders to develop and implement innovative  approaches, improve accountability, and responses to meet the health priorities  and health services needs of Canadians”. This subprogram is one of two that  supports Canadian Health Systems Policy (Program 1.1), which in turn addresses  Strategic Outcome 1: A health system responsive to the needs of Canadians. 
The design of CBRF’s  funding model is a 1:1 match, where the federal government matches all funds  raised through non-federal sources on a dollar-for-dollar basis. This model  will be discussed in greater detail later in the report. Table 1 presents CBRF’s  revenues for the years 2011-12 to 2015-16. The time periods compared are not a  direct match since CBRF (non-federal funding column) operates on the basis of a  calendar year, whereas Health Canada structures their financial data by fiscal  year.

3.0 Evaluation Description
3.1 Evaluation  Scope, Approach and Design
The scope of the  evaluation covered the period ranging from March 2012 to March 2016, and  included an examination of the Health Canada contribution to establish the  CBRF. Given that fundraising  activities started in 2012, the scope of the evaluation  was kept narrow, focusing on CBRF activities related to research funding and  the funding model itself. In addition, program data at this point in time is  output focused as it is too early for many of the outcomes to have materialized. 
The evaluation issues were  aligned with the Treasury Board of Canada’s Policy on Evaluation (2009) and  considered the five core issues under the two themes of relevance and  performance, as shown in Table 2 below. Corresponding to each of the core  issues, specific questions were developed based on program considerations and  therefore guided the evaluation process.

The Policy on Evaluation  (2009) guided the identification of the evaluation design and data collection  methods. A non-experimental design was used based on the evaluation matrix,  which outlined the evaluation strategy.
Data collection activities  were primarily carried out between March and June 2016.Footnote ix Information for the  evaluation was collected using various methods, including: document/literature  review, administrative and financial data review, and interviews with internal  and external key informants. A total of 17 interviews were conducted due to the  small scope of the evaluation and its timing of taking place within the early  stages of the Fund’s existence. Key informants were drawn from the following  groups: Health Canada (n=3); BCF (n=1); donors and former or active board  members (n=5), lead investigators (n=2); peer reviewers (n=2); one academic not  currently receiving funding from the CBRF; one representative from the Canadian  Institutes of Health Research (CIHR); one representative from the Ontario Brain  Institute (OBI); and one from the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research.  Data was analyzed by triangulating information gathered from different sources  to increase the reliability and credibility of the evaluation findings and  conclusions.
3.2 Limitations and Mitigation Strategies 
Most  evaluations face constraints that may have implications for the validity and  reliability of evaluation findings and conclusions. Table 3 outlines the  limitations encountered during the implementation of the selected methods for  this evaluation. Also noted are the mitigation strategies put in place to  ensure that the evaluation findings can be used with confidence to guide program  planning and decision-making.

Table 3: Limitations and Mitigation Strategies

Too early for a thorough assessment of the program’s achievement of outcomes
Progress towards long-term outcomes has not been explored and findings for earlier outcomes are limited.
The report refers to anecdotal evidence as early indications of progress, and where possible provides support from literature and document review sources. Limitations have been discussed in each section to provide context for potential progress. 


Key informant interviews are retrospective in nature
Interviews provide perspective on past events which can impact validity of views reported and related to the activities implemented or the results achieved. 
Triangulation of other lines of evidence to substantiate or provide further information on data received in interviews.
    The literature / document review provide background knowledge, helping contextualize and interpret interview findings.


Complex financial model 
Financial data must be reported in a manner that is not typical when compared to most federal grant and contribution programs. 
Information provided was validated with BCF audited financial statements and updates from BCF staff, as well as the contribution agreement with the department. Detailed explanations are also provided in the report, all of which have been validated by BCF. 


Limited ability to assess efficiency and economy 
Reduced ability to quantify resource utilization. 
Used other lines of evidence, including key informant interviews and administrative data review to qualitatively assess efficiency and economy.


4.0 Findings
This section  provides a summary of the evaluation findings organized under two broad  headings:

Relevance: continued need for the program; the  program’s alignment with government priorities; and whether a federal role in  brain research exists. 
Performance: achievement of intended outcomes  (effectiveness)Footnote x;  efficiency and economy of CBRF activities. 

4.1 Relevance: Issue #1 – Continued Need for the Program 
The significant and continued rise  of prevalence rates of neurological diseases, the associated costs of care as  well as the need to better understand the brain as a whole to enable  cross-cutting discoveries, supports an ongoing need for dedicated brain  research. 
Conservative estimates indicate that approximately 3.6 million people in  Canada are living with some form of neurological diseaseFootnote xi (excluding mental  illnesses).14 These findings were highlighted through  the report Mapping Connections – An Understanding of Neurological Conditions in  Canada (2014), produced in partnership by the Neurological Health Charities  Canada, the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC), Health Canada, and CIHR which  examined 17 of approximately 600 neurological diseases.15 The World Health  Organization (WHO) has stated, “diseases of the brain are predicted to surpass  cancer as the second leading cause of death in Canada by 2040”.16
Not only are the  number of people impacted by diseases of the brain expected to increase, but more  specifically, costs associated with neuropsychiatric conditionsFootnote xii are the highest in terms of the economic  burden of illness and injury in Canada, in comparison to other conditions. Between  2005-08, the direct and indirect costs of neuropsychiatric conditions were the highest  of all health conditions with an impact of approximately $12.5 billion worth of  direct and indirect costs. This represents 6.6% of the total economic burden of  illness and injury in Canada.17,Footnote xiii Since the prevalence  and incidence rates of some of the most common neurological conditions tend to  increase with age, both the number of individuals facing these challenges and  the cost of associated care are expected to rise as the Canadian population  ages.13
As illustrated in  Table 4, neuropsychiatric  conditions rank second overall in  terms of total direct costs in Canada between 2005-08Footnote xiv, consuming 6.6% of all  system resources spent in this category for the period, almost as high as the  amount of resources used to support cardiovascular diseases. As it pertains to  indirect costs, neuropsychiatric conditions consumed 6.2% of all system  resources spent in this category, ranking fourth after injuries, respiratory  infections and musculoskeletal diseases. Indirect costs refer to mortality and  morbidity related costs. Morbidity costs are based on lost productivity costs  associated with an individual’s own illness and injury. Lost productivity due  to informal caregiving for the sick and injured was not included.

Source:  Economic Burden of Illness in Canada, 2005-2008 (p. 10-11)
Several key  informants indicated that discoveries in neurological research are behind in  comparison to discoveries in other fields. As noted by WHO, “despite the huge  burden they cause, neurological conditions are largely absent from the international  health agenda. Moreover, country health plans frequently do not cover  neurological disorders at the same level as other illnesses.”18 In addition,  pharmaceutical companies have had little success in central nervous system drug  development or in uncovering any leads related to neuropharmaceutical research.  Consequently, their funding within this area of research has significantly decreased19, in spite of an aging  population “which promises a dramatic surge in brain diseases”.20 This is evidenced in  changes dating back to 2011 which saw GSK, AstraZeneca and Novartis announcing  closures of neuroscience divisions globally and in the case of Pfizer, Sanofi,  Janssen and Merck, significant downsizing of their central nervous system  research operations.21 As indicated by a few key informants, the challenge with research in this field  is that there is a lack of good targets to guide research due to the limited  breakthroughs in neuroscience to date, reflecting the vast gaps in knowledge  that still exist within this area of research and the need to share knowledge  and findings through collaborative research and shared data platforms. 
Although organizations  for other organ-specific areas of research have existed for quite some time  (e.g., the Heart and Stroke Foundation, the Kidney Foundation, etc.),  foundations focused on health research involving the brain have been created in  disease-specific silos (e.g., the MS Society, the Alzheimer’s Society, etc.). This  has created limitations in the linking of findings across diseases impacting  the brain. As highlighted by witnesses to the Subcommittee on Neurological Diseases of the  Standing Committee on Health (2012), there is a need to support research that  approaches brain diseases collectively to understand the similar degenerative  pathways involved in different neurological diseases, which would be best  addressed by the conduct of multidisciplinary research.14
4.2 Relevance: Issue #2 – Alignment with Government  Priorities
The CBRF is aligned with departmental  priorities and is contributing to federal science priorities linked to brain  health. 
Through funding to  the CBRF, Health Canada aimed to accelerate discoveries that improve the health  and quality of life for Canadians who suffer from brain disorders. This is  aligned with Health Canada’s work on Health System Priorities (subprogram  1.1.1), described in annual Departmental Performance Reports as aimed at developing and implementing innovative  approaches and responses to meet the health priorities and health service needs  of Canadians.22
According  to Mobilizing Science and Technology to Canada’s Advantage (2007)23,  scientific discoveries and new technologies can contribute to improving overall  health while providing solutions to important social challenges and improving Canada’s  economic competitiveness. Health and related life sciences and technologies were  outlined as a priority, emphasizing a new approach that encourages partnerships  with the private sector, non-profit and academia to increase the application  and commercialization of research. In this context, the creation of the CBRF aligns  with the Government of Canada Science and Technology Strategy’s commitment to  “strengthen public-private research and commercialization partnerships”.24 This  engagement in a public-private partnership model has allowed greater access to  funds supporting brain research by tapping into private donor sources that are  not typically available to a federal research agency (e.g., CIHR). 
Neuroscience  research in general has been on the federal agenda since 2011, as demonstrated  through a variety of federal budget commitments, including: 

Budget 2011 allocated up to $100 million to BCF to help establish CBRF. 
Budget  2014 provided $15 million per year to CIHR for a number of priorities including  the creation of the Canadian Consortium on Neurodegeneration in Aging.
Budget 2015 announced $42 million worth of funding over five years,  starting in 2015–16, to help establish the Canadian Centre for Aging and Brain  Health Innovation administered by Baycrest  Health Sciences. The mission of the Centre is to accelerate the development, commercialization and  adoption of innovative products, services and best practices to support brain  health with a specific focus on aging.25 The organization also receives funding from the Government of Ontario,  the private sector and donors of the Baycrest Foundation. 

Furthermore,  in Budget 2016, BCF’s CBRF obtained an  additional $20 million as one of the investments made to “attract and retain world-class  researchers and developing promising discoveries into applications that create  value for Canadians”.26 This last budget announced  that the Minister of Science would undertake a comprehensive review of all  elements of federal support for fundamental science, including granting  councils. The report, planned to be available by the end of 2016, intends to  assess the Government of Canada’s flexibility to respond to emerging research  opportunities; opportunities to increase the impact of federal support in  research; the support for promising researchers; and to bring greater coherence  to the federal research and development priorities and funding instruments.
4.3 Relevance: Issue #3 – Alignment with Federal  Roles and Responsibilities
The role of the CBRF aligns with the  federal government roles in research and science. Although there may  be some overlap between CBRF and CIHR research funding offerings, the two  organizations are more complementary than duplicative. 
The  Department of Health Act establishes Health Canada’s role in the promotion and  preservation of the physical, mental and social wellbeing of the people of Canada (section 4(2)(a.1)). Health research provides a greater  understanding of effective prevention and treatment approaches  to support the desired health outcomes listed above. As stated in the Standing  Committee on Health report (2012), the federal government has a research and  surveillance role related to neurological diseases; this role is carried out  through the work of CIHR, the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI),  and PHAC.
CBRF  was positioned at its outset as a contribution to the Federal Science and  Technology Strategy (2007) managed by the Department of Innovation, Science and Economic  DevelopmentFootnote xv,  the federal lead for science matters.
The discussion of duplication and  complementarity in the area of health research can seem clear at first glance. There  are multiple research agencies and, within the federally funded research  landscape, CIHR traditionally awards federal health research funds and  collaborates with  research institutes, foundations and charities that are diverse in terms of  geography, focus and capacity. In comparing CIHR and BCF, several key  informants were in agreement that differences in governance structures and  types of projects funded by the two research bodies lent more so to complementarity  than duplication (Table 5). During the period under evaluation, CIHR research  grants did not promote interdisciplinary research or multi-investigator teams,  which are the foundational criteria for CBRF grants. CBRF requires a  cross-cutting collaborative approach in order to promote research that  understands the brain as a whole and consequently can advance understandings of  the organ in its overall function thereby benefiting various areas of research,  versus a more disease-specific approach. Furthermore, CIHR pursues research  objectives through their 13 different siloed institutesFootnote xvi covering  the many facets of health, ranging from policy research, identity factors  linked to health (e.g., gender, aging, Aboriginal peoples), and  disease-specific areas of research (e.g., cancer). Not only is health funding distributed  across the full spectrum of health research categories, within the institute  that relates to neuroscience, they must manage their research funds across the  competing categories of mental health and addictions as well. Brain Canada, on  the other hand, dedicates all of their research funding to neuroscience. 
Federally funded research is not typically  funded through the securing of major gift donations from private donors. The  donation source has implications for the way in which projects are developed  and the nature of the research conducted. CIHR must fund research that aligns  with the institutes’ long-term strategies, and operates within the context of  an organization comprised of 13 institutes covering all aspects of the health portfolio,  rather than a focused specialization. BCF has a brain-specific research mandate  and has the flexibility to develop research priorities in consultation with  donors and scientists without requiring certain amounts of funding to be  channeled within particular research themes. 
BCF could be characterized as taking on  projects with a greater degree of risk, in comparison to a government agency,  while also taking steps to implement risk mitigation mechanisms (e.g., ongoing  evaluations). A few donor and peer review key informants confirmed BCF’s  selection of more innovative projects. The most commonly cited difference  between CIHR and CBRF mentioned by key informants was Brain Canada’s funding of  research teams versus individual investigators. Of note, since the launch of  CBRF, CIHR implemented the new Open Suite of Programs funding schemesFootnote xvii,27 in  2016 for the health portfolio at large, which are “designed to meet the needs  of a broader disciplinary mix of researchers within CIHR’s mandate”.28 The  degree of experience the two organizations have in funding research varies  greatly. BCF has funded 138 projects in the first few years of its existence,  while CIHR has funded 1,765 grantsFootnote xviii between 2011/12-2015/16 (of which 37 were team grants).29

In the case of the PSGs, several  key informants and an environmental scan demonstrated that there is little  overlap within the field for this type of work despite a crucial need for  further maintenance and capacity building to enable the use of platforms to  link research findings across the brain community.Footnote xix,30 As one key informant noted, in  the past there have been many opportunities to fund these mechanisms but little  engagement to do so. Typically, the few organizations involved in funding PSGs  target the development of new platforms, whereas CBRF is concerned with the  maintenance of existing platforms and capacity building activities to ensure  researchers are maximizing platforms already in place. 
4.4 Performance: Issue #4 – Achievement of Expected  Outcomes (Effectiveness)
In this section, we outline the extent to which  key program outcomes have been achieved. Given the recent launch of the Fund, the  evaluation has focused on the immediate and intermediate outcomes that in time will  lead to the ultimate outcome featured in the CBRF’s logic model. Therefore, we  have examined CBRF performance in the areas of: increasing research  collaboration and the number of discoveries related to knowledge of the brain,  therapies and interventions; strengthening the brain research community; and  increasing the use of the new therapies, interventions, diagnostic tools and  products.   
Projects  that have received funding through CBRF are still in progress. At the time of  the evaluation, only five of the 82 MIRI projects had concluded (see Table 8). As  a result, this limits the extent to which outcomes can be assessed. Therefore  with such a small sample, outcome-related findings may change over time as  projects continue to progress through their funding periods (which will come to  an end over the next few years, some as late as 2020). 
4.4.1 To what extent have the outcomes been achieved?
Outcome #1: Increased research  collaboration in identified priority areas.
Collaboration and  multidisciplinarity are mandatory requirements to access CBRF funds, which, by  design, translate into atypical disciplines taking part in research projects in  the area of brain sciences. 
Brain Canada takes a whole-of-brain approach  designed to broaden discoveries that could further impact understandings of the  brain as well as related pathologies across brain diseases. Consequently,  specific priority research areas were not clearly defined by Brain Canada  beyond the general criteria that relates to “any area of neural function and  dysfunction, including special senses, neurological and mental health, and may  involve biomedical, clinical, health services or population health approaches.”31,32 Commonly held  research challenges across the neuro research community have identified brain  research as the next frontier with much to learn, presenting challenges in  identifying specific targets for the field at large. Although this creates  challenges in assessing the extent to which the Fund has increased research in  ‘identified priority areas’, the approach does speak to the context within  which the brain research community operates. Since 2013, BCF has conducted  consultations in regards to underfunded areas of research, and determined more  work is needed in relation to early diagnosis and prevention, stem cells,  neuroplasticity and epigenetics. According to Brain Canada, funding initiatives  are kept broad to respect the importance of work at all stages of the brain  research continuum with the understanding that projects are approved based on  their likelihood of producing beneficial understandings which contribute to the  field. This approach is reflected through the thematic breakdown of CBRF  projects (including MIRIs, PSGs, and awards) awarded thus far:

Neurodegenerative  (40/138 projects representing 27.3% of funding committed) focused on Alzheimer’s  and Parkinson’s diseases, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, mild cognitive  impairment, Lhermitt-Duclos disease and front temporal lobar degeneration and  dementias. 
Multiple  diseases (34/138 or 19.2% of funds committed) refer to projects which span  several categories and/or cannot be classified into one specific category. For  instance, a project may pertain to an underlying mechanism of disease or injury  that is applicable to several neurological disorders or to a platform for drug  development, imaging, data-sharing etc. that is applicable to several  neurological disorders.
Neurodevelopmental  (20/138 projects or 16.3% of funds committed) focused on autism spectrum  disorder, fragile X syndrome, developmental dyscaculia, self-regulation and  fetal alcohol spectrum disorder. 
Neuropsychiatric  and mental health (12/138 projects or 13.4% of funds committed) focused on  topics such as addictions, schizophrenia, mood disorders, stress, anxiety and depression. 
Injuries  (16/138 or 11.0% of funds committed) focused on stroke, paediatric brain  injury, spinal cord and traumatic brain injuries. 
Brain  cancer (12/138 or 7.6% of funds committed) focused on medullablastoma, brain  tumor and metastases.
Other  (4/138 or 5.2% of funds committed) include projects on epilepsy, migraines and  the visual system.

Considering the crossroads of the context of  neuro research and assessing the program’s progress towards achieving its  intended outcome of collaboration in identified priority areas, it is important  to explore the degree of influence donors have on research priorities. Interviews  with CBRF donors demonstrated varying perceptions of their degree of influence  in defining research priorities. This ranged from some who felt the process was  collaborative (e.g., they expressed their specific area of interest and Brain  Canada suggested broadening the approach thereby increasing the likelihood of  uncovering new insights and findings that could impact the field as a whole). Another  organization engaged in CBRF research projects based on alignment with their  current programs. The remaining interviewee explained donors can determine  where funding goes. This environment is consistent with funder engagement  exemplified in the Canadian Council on Social Development’s study of 100 non-profit  and voluntary sector organizations across the country. Their research found  that “funders are adopting an increasingly targeted approach to funding”.33 Ultimately, CBRF documentation  and some key informant interviews expressed that typically there is alignment  among donor and BCF research areas of interest, which is particularly important  for charitable foundations that need to ensure the funds they donate are used  for research that matches the expectations of their donors. Furthermore, BCF  has an arm’s length council, SAC, in place to ensure that research funded  continues to push the neuroscience field forward. This council is composed of  prominent international researchers representing the spectrum of brain  disorders. They provide foresight on the research opportunities, trends and  challenges in the field to situate Canada globally in the latest developments, and  so that CBRF funded initiatives are at the forefront of neuro research. 
Collaboration and multidisciplinarity are  fundamental elements of the CBRF delivery model. Many of the key informants  found the collaborative approach of CBRF to be a positive approach and one of the  Fund’s distinguishing factors. As expressed by the WHO, “partnerships are  advantageous in enhancing the effectiveness of interventions, increasing the  resources available through joint actions and avoiding a duplication of  efforts”.34 Not only were key  informants pleased with the type of research CBRF was able to facilitate,  several key informants made note of the impact such resources have on  attracting and retaining well respected neuroscientists in Canada. Some key  informants highlighted that team grants have brought new people into the  community to work on brain sciences, allowing for new perspectives to be  incorporated thereby overcoming some of the siloed approaches experienced in  the research field. 
By the end of 2015, more than 700 researchers  based out of 70 institutions had been engaged in at least one of Brain Canada’s  138 projects.35 Types of partners involved included, but were not limited to, provincial organizations,  research institutes, and the pharmaceutical industry. The nature of the MIRI  grants ultimately provides the funding mechanism to foster open collaboration  among the research community, which according to Brain Canada, had been missing  in the past. A few key informants also highlighted that the funding mechanism  through CBRF helped alleviate some of the challenges of pursuing funding for  multidisciplinary research. 
Moreover, the uniqueness of the types of  multidisciplinary research efforts were of note. The involvement of experts  from varying disciplines provides the opportunity for a more fulsome  understanding and additional learning opportunities “between individuals,  between disciplines, and between types of knowledge”.36 Examples of brain  research projects that demonstrated a mix of disciplines and interests not traditionally observed in the field  of brain research, include projects on:Footnote xx

Neurodegeneration, which involved investigators in epigenetics and  biophotonics;
Carrier-mediated delivery into the brain relied  on investigators from the fields of biochemistry,  mental health / molecular and cellular cognition, molecular genetics, clinical  immunology and developmental and stem cell biology; 
The  use of endogenous neural stem cells to promote brain cell repair involves investigators in cell  and molecular developmental neurobiology, developmental psychology, cognitive neurobiology, hematology /  neuro-oncology; 
Non-invasive treatment of paediatric  neurological disorders using MR-guided focused ultrasound relies on researchers  in biomedical engineering and neurosurgical imaging; and
Focus on  Brain project, a collaborative effort involving Consortium Québécois sur le  développement des médicaments (CQDM) and the OBI involves research focused on  the blood-brain barrier. This partnership with the pharmaceutical industry has  the ability to facilitate a greater understanding of pharma priorities, potential  targets, and the challenges associated with accelerating drug development for  neuro-related treatments. 

As expressed by one of Brain Canada’s  international review members, “what has impressed me the most is the  synergistic interaction of the various research groups that would likely  otherwise have not collaborated without the financial support of Brain Canada. In  my view, this has moved the science significantly forward.”Footnote xxi
Outcome #2: Increased discoveries  related to knowledge of the brain, new therapies, interventions, diagnostics  and products. 
The  majority of the projects have only recently been initiated, therefore it is too early to determine the  breadth of discoveries relating to the brain, therapies,  interventions, diagnostic tools and products that would be stemming from CBRF funded research activities. There are early  indications of findings in specific cases, that have the potential to  meaningfully contribute to the brain science field. At this point in time, it  appears the portfolio of projects that  have been funded is well balanced in terms of translational, pre-clinical and  clinical research.
The original contribution agreement between Health Canada and BCF came  into effect March 2012. Only one  PSG project started receiving funding in 2014 and the 21 remaining projects  received funding in 2015. Furthermore, training awards account for a relatively  small portion of CBRF funding. As a result, this section focuses primarily on  MIRI projects. BCF’s 2014 annual report stated 77 projects had been confirmed  under the following research categories: 25 basic research, 19 translational  research, 15 pre-clinical, 14 projects at the clinical stage, two public  health, and two projects with combined research categories. 
Considering the time needed to raise funds and to conduct the peer  review process for selecting research projects, as well as carrying out the  project itself, only five projects had concluded at  the time of the evaluation. This limits the feasibility of assessing program  outcomes at this point in time. As a result, this section will focus on relevant  outputs that serve to lay a foundation for future outcomes to materialize. 
The five projects that concluded in 2015  stemmed from the 2014 Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) Hudson and Discovery  grants, a partnered program with ALS Societies of Canada. According to ALS Canada, the Discovery Grant program provided $100,000 for  funding highly novel ALS research which would otherwise have had difficulty in  obtaining funding from traditional sources. ALS discovery grants were aimed at  helping researchers build a foundation of results to boost their future  applications to multi-year opportunities.,37 Research  results from the five completed projects had not been published at the time of  this evaluation.
Other projects have resulted  in publications contributing to the greater brain science body of knowledge. BCF, based on reporting  received from 43 of 63 projects, identifies a total of 169 publications with  Brain Canada acknowledgement, out of which 83 stem from MIRI projects, 16 from  PSGs and 70 from training awards. Articles are published in peer  reviewed journals and other academic publications such as the American Journal  of Psychiatry, Biological Psychiatry and Genome Research. At the time of this  report, 20 projects had yet to reach their first submission deadline, therefore  the amount of publications cited above is most likely a modest representation.
Based  on key informant interviews, below are some examples of discoveries resulting  from CBRF projects:

Azrieli  Neurodevelopmental Research Program Phase 1- Structural and functional networks  in Autism Spectrum Disorder and Fragile X syndromeMIRI: The team was able to build off their previous work  which identified early biomarkers for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) beginning  at two years of age, earlier than the field’s typical timing of at least three  years old. The work completed through the MIRI grant replicated that research  process in order to uncover ASD biomarkers at the 12 and 6 month age ranges. At  the time of this evaluation, these findings were scheduled to be published  within the weeks to follow. The importance of this research is that it  contributes to facilitating ASD clinical diagnoses at earlier ages, before most  of the damage has already been done. This team also produced a data review by  using a platform based out of 13 research centres located in North America and  Europe. As a result of this project, data across studies was cleaned to identify  findings that had not previously been uncovered through this public database. Prior  to their research, the science community had found essentially no difference between  normally developing children and those with autism. The research through the Acquired  brain injury (ABI) dataset, identified a pattern of changes in the cortical  thickness throughout different parts of the brain from ages 6 to 30 years old.
Antipsychotic treatment in a genetic subtype of  schizophrenia: Novel insights from neuroimaging and pharmacogenetics (Training  Award): the award recipient was able to complete a systemic evaluation of  antipsychotic response with patients carrying the 22q11.2DS marker, a high risk  marker for Parkinson’s disease and a molecular subtype for schizophrenia. She  has authored 11 scientific manuscripts, including four as first author, on the  expression of schizophrenia and Parkinson’s disease in adults presenting with  the important genetic syndrome. Her independent work as well as research she  has contributed to has proposed, “practical strategies for the recognition,  evaluation, surveillance, and management of the associated morbidities”.Footnote xxii,38

It is still premature  to assess the breadth of discoveries emerging out of CBRF funded work that has  just recently begun, but anecdotal  evidence gathered suggests progress is expected in the coming years, with some  of the work having been identified as potentially contributing to advances in  the field of brain sciences (e.g., epigenetics, motor neurons).
Outcome #3: Strengthened Canadian brain research community
While it is still early in the  research process for projects funded by CBRF to fully achieve this outcome,  indications from interviews and processes like establishing and maintaining  partnerships, and the selection of broad-based research projects, have started  to contribute to a strengthened brain research community. 
The CBRF approach to strengthening the brain research  community39 first  rests on the need to consider the brain as one system, recognizing that common  mechanisms are involved among a range of neurological diseases and disorders, mental  illnesses, addictions, brain and spinal cord injuries. Secondly, many people from  diverse, and potentially non-traditional backgrounds and expertise from equally  diverse organizations can work together to accelerate progress. 
  It is only recently that the whole-brain approach and  cross-disease commonalities advocated by BCF have garnered more interest among  researchers, and support by other funding organizations and governments, as indicated  in the report released by the Subcommittee on Neurological Diseases of the  Standing Committee on Health (2012). This approach is considered to be an  innovative and beneficial approach to neurological research, as evidenced by  the document review and many of the key informant interviews.
Although sources confirmed the benefits of a multidisciplinary  approach to neuro research (driven by a whole-of-brain lens), this particular  intermediate outcome is anticipated to materialize within 7-15 years of the  initial launch of the program. As such, it is too early to assess the extent to  which CBRF has strengthened the Canadian brain research community. Therefore,  the following section is not to serve as a determination of the extent to which  this outcome has been achieved; rather, it serves to highlight early  indications of positive contributions in this area based on annual reports and  key informant interviews.
The general structure of MIRI grants are designed with the  intent of strengthening the brain research community. As indicated on the Brain  Canada MIRI proposal webpage, “the focus of proposals must be on investigating  commonalities among multiple or related neurological and/or psychiatric  conditions. The proposal must show how the research will generate findings  applicable to multiple nervous system diseases or conditions.”Footnote xxiii As a  result, the CBRF encourages proposals coming from investigators working in  diverse and sometimes atypical disciplines for the field of research being  funded, as a means to incorporate broadened perspectives. 
As mentioned earlier, it is still too early to make an  assessment across projects as to the impact from these collaborative research  opportunities. However, anecdotal evidence suggests that such grants have  facilitated cross-disciplinary teams, often with innovative approaches. Ultimately,  this exposure to and coming together of researchers who often work in siloed  but complementary fields leads to a more all-encompassing approach to brain  science research. For example, in the case of the 2014 grant awarded to a lead  researcher based out of the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, the open  call linked to that grant was seeking a team to develop effective strategies for  the prevention of Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders with the additional  criteria of originality, feasibility and multidisciplinarity. Up until that  point, the lead researcher had dedicated his career to conducting clinical  trials for older patients with mood disorders.40 Through  his MIRI grant research, his team was able to establish a link between the  mechanisms involved in depression and those occurring in Alzheimer’s disease. A  key informant noted that this group of researchers, because of their  untraditional areas of expertise, would most likely not have applied nor been  considered for other funders’ open call competitions (e.g., Canadian Consortium  on Neurodegeneration in Aging). Leaders in the field of Alzheimer prevention were  a part of the selection committee and recognized that this project was the most  promising alternative currently available to prevent the development  and progression of Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders.41 The experts  estimate that it may realistically lead to a medical intervention accessible to  Canadians within a five year timeframe.
Not only are CBRF’s MIRI projects supporting the coming  together of researchers from various fields, there are indications of relationship  development across complementary organizations. Specifically, BCF is liaising  with the Mental Health Commission of Canada in order to stay abreast of the  findings of their research, providing BCF the opportunity to pursue lines of  study that have been determined as requiring further investigation. The  eventual goal is that BCF will be able to incorporate some of the learnings  from the Mental Health Commission of Canada’s research into the mental health research  programs BCF might eventually develop. 
The relationships and teams developed through CBRF have  expanded beyond Canadian borders. There has been international interest in  learning more about Brain Canada’s public/private partnership. As a result,  Brain Canada’s President/CEO has presented to audiences in Holland, Israel, the  USA, and the UK, based on their respective parties’ interest in creating models  that would stimulate more donations to brain research. 
A few key informants indicated that the funding CBRF injects  into brain research has helped to attract key international scientists to the  Canadian research community. Furthermore, the availability of funding, according  to a few key informants, has also served to provide opportunities that appeal  to local researchers, facilitating their continued work in Canada. The PSGs for major research platforms are designed to  enhance technical and research capacity to support the sharing of research  evidence among multiple investigators working in the brain sciences field,  irrespective of location. CBRF does not fund the development of the  infrastructure itself, it is complementary to the Canada Foundation for  Innovation’s grants for research platform infrastructure. BCF had found that  there were platforms in existence which would provide greater access to  research findings for other investigators across the country, but found a  limited number of people were accessing them due to a lack of technical  expertise and limited funds for upkeep and expansion. These PSGs allow the  recruitment and training of specialized personnel needed to operate the  platforms and allow for those tools and techniques to be more widely accessible  and used. The applicability of these platforms is wide reaching and can provide  a base of findings for researchers working in a variety of disease specific  areas by exploring trends in relationships between different factors  (variables), further supporting a whole-of-brain research approach. 
There were specific examples where the PSGs had enabled  greater access to research findings across the brain science field: 

Canadian Brain Imaging Research  Platform (CBRAIN): The platform connects over 300 researchers in brain imaging  centres located within Canada and internationally. It provides access to large  data sets and combined capacity in analyzing findings across multi-centre  research projects. The platform also “provides a framework that can be  configured to accept and analyze data from any discipline” which going forward allows  it to be used in a variety of different brain research settings at a national  level.25 As of October 2013, CBRAIN was serving over 200 users,  based out of 52 cities across 17 countries42,  demonstrating an increase in users from August 2010 (40 members) and December  2011 (116 members).43
The Experimental Imaging Centre- A  Local Brain Canada Platform for Preclinical MR Neuroimaging: Following the  closure of the National Research Council Institute of Biodiagnostics in 2012,  the technical support provider for the Experimental Imaging Centre (EIC) at the  Cumming School of Medicine (University of Calgary), the continued existence of  the program came into question. The program credits CBRF’s platform grant for  the financial bridging which made it possible to continue their MIRI-based  research, as well as expand their neuroscience research capacity.44

As indicated earlier, the evaluation acknowledges early  indications of a strengthening of the brain research community, but a further  assessment of impacts should take place once the intermediate outcome timeframe  (7-15 years) has come to fruition.
Outcome #4: Increased  use of new therapies, interventions, diagnostics tools and products
The CBRF’s projected intermediate  outcome timeline of requiring up to 15 years for increased use of research  findings to materialize, is consistent with research implementation studies. At  this stage, it is too early to assess the extent to which the outcome has been  achieved. Anecdotal evidence suggests that some of the discoveries resulting  from CBRF research have the potential for downstream impacts in this area.
As indicated by a  few key informants and in some health research impact evaluation literature,  there is often a delay between the generation of research discoveries and the  dissemination and/or application of that research in the community.45 The downstream impacts of  health research are rarely demonstrable in the short-term. Furthermore, only  14% of clinical research actually progresses to full implementation. In those  select cases where original (i.e., discovery) clinical research becomes  integrated into physical practice, the average amount of time to progress to  full implementation was 17 years.31 This is consistent with the 7-15  year timeframe assigned to this CBRF outcome, and provides insight into  expectations surrounding the extent to which this outcome is likely to be  achieved. A recent impact assessment of health intervention research funded by Australia’s National Health  and Medical Research Council recommends that assessments of the impact of  health research should allow sufficient time between impact data collection and  completion of the original research.46 The study was based on research that  found it can take up to 17 years for evidence to be translated into practice.47,48
Given that CBRF  research projects started receiving funding in 2013, it is too early to assess  many of the resulting impacts, including the use of new therapies,  interventions, diagnostics tools or products. Literature review sources suggest  that anticipated milestones that could demonstrate progress towards use-related  outcomes resulting from research discoveries include: the initiation of  clinical trials (including investment, partnerships and ethics approval),  regulatory approval, and business plans or pharmaco-economic evaluations for  marketization of products, where applicable.Footnote xxiv
At this point in  time, some key informants have indicated that, in select cases, early evaluations  and clinical trials for therapeutic approaches that build on CBRF-funded  discoveries are in place. The research described below is anecdotal evidence gathered  through key informant interviews, demonstrating progress toward pre-evaluative  or clinical trial milestones:

Mobilizing  stem cells in the brain to treat brain injury in children (2013 W. Garfield  Weston Foundation – Brain Canada Foundation Multi-Investigator Research  Initiative): Through her prior research, the lead researcher made a discovery  on the reprogramming of skin cells into neural cells. With CBRF funding, this  investigator is now able to pursue further research to determine if treatment  with metaformin and/or physical exercise could stimulate recruitment of  endogenous healthy brain stem cells to the site of injury in children and  teenagers. A key informant indicated that the findings from this project, which  is expected to wrap up in 2016, have the potential to lead to new treatments  for brain repair and would allow for rapid uptake.
ALS-Canada  – Brain Canada J. Hudson Translational Team Grant (2015): The team received  funding to advance their preliminary discovery of an active ingredient found in  Withaferin somnifera (a plant) which acts as an inhibitor of an inflammatory  response involved in ALS. It is difficult to source and extract this  active ingredient in large volumes, presenting challenges in proceeding to  clinical trials. The CBRF grant is supplying funding for the pre-clinical  (laboratory) studies of a drug the lead researcher identified in collaboration with  ImStar Therapeutics Inc, that may share the characteristics  of the original active ingredient. If successful, the research will continue  through to clinical trials at the Montreal Neurological Institute.49 According  to one key informant, the best-case scenario in which pre-clinical and clinical  trials would proceed successfully without significant barriers, would result in  clinical trials beginning within four years and the compound would be approved  for market eight years from now. 

4.5 Performance: Issue #5 – Demonstration of Economy and Efficiency 
The Treasury Board  of Canada’s Policy on Evaluation (2009) and guidance document, Assessing  Program Resource Utilization When Evaluating Federal Programs (2013), defines  the demonstration of economy and efficiency as an assessment of resource  utilization in relation to the production of outputs and progress toward  expected outcomes. This assessment is based on the assumption that departments  have standardized performance measurement systems and that financial systems  link information about program costs to specific inputs, activities, outputs  and expected results. 
In the case of CBRF,  the implementation of the fund is assumed by a third party (BCF), which  maintains a data structure aligned with the requirement associated with the  production of financial statements rather than activity-based costing. Therefore,  the data structure necessary for assessing whether program outputs were  produced efficiently, or whether expected outcomes were produced economically was  not available. Considering these issues, the evaluation provided observations  on economy and efficiency based on findings from some key informant interviews  as well as relevant administrative and financial data available.
Observations on  Economy 
Operating expenses that were associated with  the administration of CBRF are below the allowed levels. Mechanisms are in  place and used to assess projects’ progress and use of funds to ensure CBRF  funds are disbursed diligently. 
Under the terms of the funding agreement, a maximum of up to 10% of federal  funding can be used for operating expenses related to the management,  administration and overhead specific to the CBRF or for the design of the  research programs, call for proposals, peer review, monitoring and evaluation  of research awards.50 Administration  fees are calculated on a case-by-case basis for the non-federal funds and can  range up to 10% as well. CBRF 2011 to 2015 operating expensesFootnote xxv were $7,085,615 which accounts for 8.8% of overall Health Canada funding ($38,333,269)  and CBRF spending ($42,336,719 ).
The 2007 Evaluation of Foundations, conducted by the Government of  Canada, found that the majority of foundations with yearly disbursements under  $40 million, dedicated between 29% and 51% to operating expenses, which  suggests that CBRF’s operational expenditures are more lean than the norm when benchmarked  against similar organizations. Larger foundations disbursing between $40  million and $80 million annually operate on 7% to 11% of total expenses while  granting councils typically operate on 5% to 6% of total expenses. In 2015,  CIHR operating expenses amounted to 6.05% of their total expenses51 which is comparable to CBRF within the same time period.
A key informant reported that the detailed annual progress reports  requested from investigators are used to validate progress towards achieving  project objectives and serve to monitor expenditures made during a given year.  Variances in project expenditures that exceed 20% must be explained and a  justification for modifications to project budgets is required. Since BCF tends  to pursue ideas that are slightly riskier than federal granting agencies, they  in turn make efforts to mitigate that risk through a comprehensive project evaluation  process. Monitoring ensures that CBRF funds are used towards the completion of  research project objectives and prevents a continued transfer of funds to  projects that have yet to use the full amount of funding provided. There are  rarely incidents of underspending; in the select cases where it has occurred,  projects have provided justification that are beyond the control of the project  lead, such as contracting issues. 
Description of the funding model
A key feature of the CBRF, as detailed in their contribution agreement,  is related to acquiring private investments to facilitate brain-related  research, which ultimately provides the base for a matching federal government  contribution. This engagement of private donors diversifies the donor base and  is seen to help strengthen  the case for brain research as a philanthropic cause and provides impetus for  sustained private funding, beyond the period in which a federal government  investment is in place. 
Eligible contributions may  come from: provincially-funded organizations with independent governance, such  as universities, hospitals and research institutes; provincial funding  agencies; charitable and philanthropic associations and foundations; individual  donors; and private-sector corporations. Governmental and non-governmental  organizations that receive more than 51% of their funding from the federal  government are not eligible. 
While the focus of the  contribution agreement is on philanthropy, the BCF noted that its fundraising  activities were also a way to attract provincial investments in brain research.  Challenges in acquiring provincial donations will be discussed later in the  section related to the structure of the funding model. 
CBRF operates under a deferral accounting  method for contributions, where donations received are allocated to covering expenses  of future periods and are earmarked for specific programs. In the interim, Health  Canada funds are only permitted to be invested in low risk vehicles (e.g.,  interest bearing certificates of deposit or Treasury Board bills issued by the  government) while the peer review and selection process take place. 
In 2011/12- 2012/13, Health Canada provided BCF  with a combined advance of $20 million (out of the original $100 million  allocated) in order to help launch their fundraising and research programs. The  contribution agreement requires that the advance be matched before the end of  the funding agreement. BCF intends to match the advanced amount from the first  two years starting in 2016-17 through to 2018-19.
Amounts of non-federal funding raised
The amount received by the  Foundation from non-government sources (Figure 2) increased from $6,747,567 in  2012 up to $17,337,305 in 2015, for an overall total of $35,670,574. Within the  first three months of 2016, an additional $5,783,478 had been raised. In  addition, $44,795,948 in donations, to be received across 2016/17-2019/20, have  already been committed through contractual agreements with non-governmental  donors. Therefore, to date $86,250,000 in non-federal funding has been secured.  In order to match the initial $100 million commitment and the additional $20  million influx, BCF has an outstanding $33,750,000 to raise from non-federal  sources within the timeframe of 2016-17 to 2019-20.

Figure 2 - Long Description
This figure depicts a pie graph showing the amount received by the Foundation from non-government sources and the amount that still needs to be raised to meet program commitments. The graph shows that from 2012 to 2015 a total of $35,670,574 in donations had been received with an additional $5,783,478 having been raised in the first three months of 2016.  In addition, it shows that $44,795,948 in donations, to be received across 2016/17-2019/20, have already been committed through contractual agreements with non-governmental donors. It further shows that in order to match the initial $100 million commitment and the additional $20 million influx, BCF has an outstanding $33,750,000 to raise from non-federal sources within the timeframe of 2016-17 to 2019-20.



Sources of non-federal funding
To achieve its objective of securing the original $100  million in federal funding through a 1:1 matching structure, the BCF’s plan was  to target gifts over $100,000 from private donors (non-governmental sources).  Ultimately, during  the period of 2011-2015 (Table 7), 33 (59%) of the 56 donations qualified as  major gifts, of which approximately 49% of those donations exceeded $500,000. Although  funding from foundations (35.6%) and academic institutions (18.2%) were the  highest value donor groups from non-governmental sources, only 40% (4 of 10) of  foundations’ and approximately 50% (11 of 21) of academic institutions’  donations qualified as major gifts. Whereas, mid-range and smaller donor  categories comprised of voluntary health organizations (4.2% of CBRF funds  raised), private donors (14.5%), and ‘other’ donors (16.6%) were fully made-up  of major gift donations. 
The  remaining donations to CBRF that did not qualify as a major gift had a value  ranging from $10,000 to $99,000, with the exception of one which was less than  $10,000. Although the original goal of a solely major gifts approach to raising  funds accounted for a little less than 2/3 of overall donations, the remaining  amounts secured through individual donor sources were still of a significant  dollar value.

Source: BCF, Amounts  received by funding sources by year 
Research  Activity and Funds Disbursed
According to BCF data, the annual amounts disbursed since  2011 through grants and awards ranged from $78,513 in 2011 to $30,874,988 in  2015. These amounts increased quite drastically from one year to the next due to  the start of new projects which overlapped with those already in their second  or third year. 
The shaded zones in Table 8 on the following page highlight the  duration of MIRI research projects and the number of projects expected to  conclude by year and research program. There are lags between when projects are  selected and the start date of the actual research projects. For example, the  funds associated with grants awarded under the Sponsored MIRI 2012 started  being disbursed in 2014 to allow for the completion of the peer review process.  The milestones are similar for the British Columbia Alzheimer’s Research Award  Program for which the request for applications was launched in December 2013,  although funding was not received until 2015. 
As  CBRF was getting established, there were delays in securing donations and  consequently, because of the structure of the matched funding model, Health  Canada had to reprofile funding for the program. As well, the focus on major  gift donations ($100K or more) has resulted in a high proportion of donations  being committed in instalment payments over several years. Health Canada funding  was reprofiled in November 2014 and August 2015 to match the amount of  non-federal donations that BCF received, which was below the departmental  reference level. In 2015, the contribution agreement between Health Canada and  BCF was extended to March 31, 2020 to allow for the disbursement of the funds  raised and matched towards the end of the original cycle. In 2016, funding for  CBRF will be reprofiled again.

Matching
The strength of this funding arrangement is  its foundational structure of a private-public partnership. The matching of  private donations by the federal government was seen by key informants as a  powerful incentive that appeals to non-federal donors interested in investing  in brain research, and taps into new sources of funding for this particular  field. There were a few instances where key informants criticized a matching  model as shying away from a predetermined government commitment to fund an area  of research deemed a priority. These key informants highlighted that the  matching model puts the onus on the organization to raise funds in order to get  the full federal amount of funding pledged for a research area which the government  itself has prioritized. Despite these concerns, overall, key informants  indicated that this model has resulted in an increase of funds available for  brain research. Furthermore, an environmental scan of funding models for other  research organizations indicates that matching models are quite common,  although the matching ratios vary (Table 9). CBRF is the only organization  reviewed that had a 1:1 matching formula.
Some key informants called into question  research-related expenses eligible for matching. Unlike the other research  organizations explored through the environmental scan (e.g., OBI, Genome Canada,  Grand Challenges (Table 9)), CBRF does not capture in-kind contributions in the  total value eligible for matching. As expressed by one MIRI team lead, the exclusion  of the in-kind value associated with their staff time, administration costs,  and equipment was cause for concern since their institution already has an  indirect cost ratio of roughly $0.52 on the dollar. 
Administration Costs
Capturing administration costs  within the matched funding model was regularly cited as a challenge among  external and BCF key informants. According to the contribution agreement, up to  10% of federal funds received can be applied towards administration costs. The  environmental scan found that CBRF’s administration cost ratio is in line with  select organizations featured in the environmental scan (e.g., Grand Challenges  Canada, Genome Canada). A few key informants challenged the idea of the CBRF  funding model where operational expenses for the organization are not  distinctly funded (outside of the funds received through the matching  structure). Although the contribution agreement’s stipulations concerning the  percentage of funding allocated to administrative costs is only specific to  federal funds received, without distinct funds for these costs, BCF applies up  to a 10% administration fee on some non-federal funds received in order to  cover the balance of operational expenses. BCF and donor key informants  confirmed that some funders are reluctant to have their money cover  administrative costs and at times alternate arrangements are pursued in order  to respect the expectations of donors. Examples include having designated administrative costs  funnelled to funding interns working at Brain Canada. Also, since the  contribution agreement requires all federal funds to be matched, including  administration fees (up to 10% of federal funding), this decreases the  advertised 1:1 matching ratio to an approximately 90%  match of funding from the federal government for research conducted through  CBRF. As discussed earlier, CBRF administration costs account for 8.8% of all  funding received, which is below the maximum threshold of 10%. As to be  expected, the administrative costs (as a ratio) were higher during the initial  start-up years of the Fund but have consistently decreased over the period  under evaluation, ranging from approximately 22% in 2013 to 4.4% in 2015. 
Challenges in the  operationalization of the flow-through method
Based on an environmental scan, and according to key  informants from BCF and OBI, the model of requiring donations to go through  CBRF’s account, then detailed in their audited financial statements in order to  trigger a federal transfer of funds to facilitate the match, which in turn is  disbursed to the researcher, is an atypical format. The environmental scan of select  Canadian-based research organizations (Genome Canada, OBI, Grand Challenges  Canada, Brain Canada) produced for this evaluation demonstrated that all of the  organizations included in the review engage in some form of a matching model. Most  of these organizations release funding to researchers based on a binding  attestation that the funds have been secured, rather than the requirement faced  by CBRF to have funds physically transferred to their account in order to  secure the federal funding match (Table 9). According to key informants,  traditionally the matching or blending of research funds tends to take place at  the research institution (e.g., university) and is formalized through a  multipartite legal agreement which stipulates the proportion of funds provided  by each partner. At the time of the evaluation, BCF and Health Canada had  confirmed that consultations/discussions related to revising the funding model  are currently underway. As indicated in internal Health Canada documents,  spending of matched funding on CBRF projects was delayed due to the process of  requiring audited financial statements prior to initiating the federal funding  match. 
Despite creating time consuming administrative practices, a  challenge identified by BCF, other key informants acknowledged limitations in  their ability to donate funds to the organization based on the way the  flow-through model has been operationalized. This was particularly relevant in  the case of not-for profit organizations using funds from their respective  donors, and agencies that receive provincial funding. 
According to the Canada Revenue Agency, a registered charity must devote its resources to  the charitable activities that directly further the charitable purposes for  which the charity was registered.52 While charitable activities can be carried out through intermediaries, the charities that choose to do so “must be able to  demonstrate that it takes an active and  controlling part in a program or project that directly achieves its  charitable purposes”.Footnote xxvi In the case of  the BCF, the Foundation does not qualify as an intermediary carrying out  charitable activities on behalf of donors since it is not directly involved in  the conduct of research, but rather serves as a funding coordinator. Charities  are accountable to their donors and must illustrate their full control of the  disbursement of donated funds. 
Charities which receive provincial funds face limitations  with a flow-through model that requires a physical transfer of funds, based on  stipulations that require that the funding they receive stay within the  province. According to BCF, the goal of increasing the flow of provincial  government investments in the field is constrained by this same intermediary  structure which is often perceived as administratively burdensome and contributes  to reduced transparency. 
Sourcing Funds
In order for a federal funding match to take  place, CBRF must receive all donations by a pre-established cut-off date. The  end date of the CBRF contribution agreement was extended to 2020, allowing for  extra time to disburse research funding but requiring all funds eligible for a  federal match to be received by 2017. As a result, funding for current multi-year  grants must be received in a lump sum upfront to trigger the match versus  annual donations throughout the research process. According to Brain Canada,  this poses challenges for not-for-profit organizations as they are unable to  accumulate money that covers a commitment spanning three years. Not-for-profit  organizations make multi-year commitments based on cash flow but they often do  not have the liquidity to supply the funding any further out than on an annual  basis. Other donors also take issue with lump sum donations covering the grant  period since research funding is disbursed to teams based on milestones achieved  and as a result the money sits in CBRF’s account until the installments are  paid out over the grant period. Donors often have more detailed investment  policies in place, meaning should the funds sit in their account until the  point where it is needed a greater amount of interest would accumulate in the  interim, as opposed to CBRF’s minimal GIC interest rates.

Observations on  efficiency 
Efficiencies resulting from BCF’s peer review process for the Fund and  the annual projects’ progress review were identified. While the matched funding  model has contributed to a greater influx of brain research money in Canada,  the model still presents challenges for BCF and their partners. 
The MIRI and PSG  peer review processes are similar despite differences in criteria pertaining  to: the eligibility of applicants, components of the application, and  assessments.62 The BCF peer review process for the Fund includes the submission of a  LOI, which provides basic information on the project, the team and the budget.  The LOI process is designed to identify the most competitive projects, and in  doing so, requesting full applications simply from the teams within that niche.  The letters are submitted during the pre-panel stage where they are examined by  a subset of the peer review committee. The LOI process has the advantage of  being less time consuming for applicants and reviewers alike by reducing the  number of full applications drafted and requiring review. In some cases, it  also gives more time for applicants to secure commitment from their sponsors.  CIHR recently incorporated an LOI stage for some of its funding opportunities  although it has not been used extensively at this point.
The efficiency of  the peer review process was determined by reviewing the proportion of proposals  rejected/consolidated at the LOI stage. This data was only available for three  MIRI competitions (Table 10). According to this limited source of information,  81% of the 2012 and 46% of 2014 sponsored MIRI applications were rejected at  the LOI stage, meaning 170 applications that were not of priority interest to  Brain Canada, did not require further applicant time for development or  dedicated time by panel members’ for the full peer review process.

The  projects’ progress is reviewed annually to monitor their use of CBRF funds and  to mitigate risks associated with the projects that were selected. Most of the  time, this review is conducted internally by the program team. One of the peer  reviewers who rated the original proposal is asked to conduct the annual  assessment in the case where the project is not straightforward. Projects are  evaluated on an ongoing basis and funding installments are only disbursed if  projects are proceeding as planned and the funds received to date have been  spent. 
5.0 Conclusions
5.1 Relevance Conclusions
Neurological conditions have been estimated to affect approximately 3.6  million Canadians and are the most costly of health conditions when accounting  for combined direct and indirect costs. The number of individuals living with neurological conditions and the  cost of associated care are expected to rise as the Canadian population ages. 
The brain has been  cited as the last frontier of health research. Key informants and document review  sources confirm that there is a continued need for research to better  understand how the brain functions. A whole-of-brain approach to research in  this field is expected to help identify similar degenerative pathways linked to a variety  of neurological diseases. 
Neuroscience research has  been a federal priority throughout the period captured in this evaluation, and  is aligned with departmental priorities. The CBRF’s innovative cross-disciplinary  and multi-investigator approach in working towards generating discoveries contributes  to current federal science priorities. Although some overlap exists, for the  most part, key informants agreed that the work of CIHR and CBRF are more  complementary than duplicative. 
5.2 Performance Conclusions 
While it is still too early to  assess the long-term outcomes resulting from the CBRF, it is evident that MIRI  grants and PSGs facilitate collaboration within the brain community and across  disciplines. This collaborative and multidisciplinary approach is seen as  promising in researching common mechanisms presenting across neurological and  psychiatric diseases. Currently, the portfolio of projects funded appear to be  well balanced in terms of translational, pre-clinical and clinical research.
An assessment of intermediate  outcome impacts would be more appropriate once the intended outcome timeframe  of 7-15 years has passed. At this point in time, anecdotal evidence suggests  that some projects demonstrate potential for downstream impacts, including new  discoveries and the use of new therapies, interventions, diagnostics, tools and  products stemming from CBRF research discoveries.
To date, CBRF’s private-public funding  partnership model has facilitated the incorporation of new sources of funding  within the research field that are typically not engaged by federally funded  research organizations. However, the operationalization of the funding  model could be improved by moving away from requiring donations be transferred  to the CBRF and verified through audited financial statements in order to  receive the matched federal funding. A shift to a less onerous approach has the  potential to better support the objective of the CBRF and build on BCF’s  capacity to maintain relationships with partners interested in increasing  overall investments in brain research. Mechanisms are in place to continually assess projects’  progress and their use of funds. In terms of administrative efficiencies, LOI peer  review process for CBRF has served to streamline the application and project  selection processes.
6.0 Recommendation
Health Canada should consider adjusting  the CBRF Funding Model.
While the CBRF funding model has clearly resulted in  increased funds being dedicated to brain research in Canada, it still faces  challenges including:

Capturing administrative costs associated with  the management of all funding and its impact on funding available for matching. 
Requirement of audited financial statements  prior to initiating federal funding match which results in delays to spending  matched funding. 
Operationalization of the flow-through funding  model that includes requirements to physically transfer funds to BCF’s account  in order to trigger a federal funding match has impacted the ability of  not-for-profits and provinces to donate money. Not-for-profits do not typically  transfer funds to intermediaries due to lack of control of disbursement of  donated funds, and provincial funders require funding to stay within the  province. 

To address these challenges HC should continue its  examination of the funding model and make necessary adjustments that ensure it  meets the needs of both BCF and Health Canada.

Achievement of Expected Outcomes (Effectiveness)


To what extent did the CBRF progress towards producing the intended outputs and achieving its intended outcomes?Outcome #1 : Increased research collaboration in identified priority areas 

Evidence of multidisciplinarity and collaboration 
Description of BCF approach to encourage collaboration across disease priority areas

Progress Made;Further Work Warranted
Collaboration and multidisciplinarity are mandatory requirements to access CBRF funds, which translates into atypical disciplines taking part in research projects in the area of brain sciences.
The whole-of-brain approach adopted by BCF and difficulties in identifying targets in the brain research field at large, lends to broad and evolving priority areas.


Outcome #2: Increased discoveries related to brain, therapies, interventions, diagnostics and products

Views of significant research advancements 
Early evidence of number of IP disclosures, patents applied for or granted, spin-offs created and licenses granted
Views of instances and case histories arising from CBRF funded research 

Unable to AssessEarly signs of progress
While it is too early to gather concrete evidence on the discoveries related to brain that would be stemming from the funded research activities, anecdotal evidence gathered suggests significant progress is expected in the few coming years. Some of this work carries the potential for significant discoveries such as the work on the blood-brain barrier and the identification of new targets for drug development. 


Outcome #3: A strengthened Canadian brain research community, due to CBRF approach and its funding of MIRI, PSGs and awards 

Views on CBRF contribution in strengthening a brain research community
Description of BCF’s approach to strengthening the brain research community

Progress Made;Further Work Warranted
CBRF projects are in their early years therefore the assessment of the extent to which they contributed to strengthening the brain research community is limited.
There are early indications from interviews, and evidenced by processes like establishing and maintaining partnerships and the selection of broad-based research projects, that have started to contribute to a strengthened brain research community.


Outcome #4: Increased use of therapies, interventions, diagnostics tools and products

Case histories of successful commercialisation of IP created by the CBRF
Case histories of use of therapies, interventions, diagnostics tools and products tied to the CBRF. 
Views on the use of therapies, interventions, diagnostics tools and products tied to the CBRF. 

Unable to Assess
Concrete evidence could not be collected to support the use of discoveries at this point in time. Anecdotal evidence suggests that some of the research currently funded may reach the stage of use within the next decade.
