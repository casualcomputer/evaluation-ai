Executive summary
This  evaluation assessed the relevance and effectiveness of the Health Care Policy  Contribution Program (HCPCP) for the period of 2013-14 to 2017-18. The  evaluation was required by the Financial Administration Act and the Treasury  Board of Canada's Policy on Results (2016). Due to changes occurring within the  program during the evaluation timeframe, it was agreed that the evaluation  would be focused in its scope and methodological approach. 
Launched  in 2002, the HCPCP is a national program that provides contribution funding to  projects that address health care system priorities. Current HCPCP priority  areas include palliative care, home care, mental health, and health care system  innovation.
Evaluation  Conclusions
 In  terms of relevance, the evaluation found that HCPCP priorities have evolved  over time and there are continuing needs within the health care system related  to current priority areas, including palliative care, home care, mental health,  and health care system innovation.   
There  was evidence of progress towards all three program outcome areas (stakeholders  are aware of knowledge products and tools, stakeholders are using knowledge  products and tools, and there are improvements in the health care system). Although  direct measurement of awareness was limited, there was other evidence related  to stakeholder awareness, including the involvement of some target audiences in  knowledge product development, and the subsequent use of some of these products.  Use varied, ranging from the development of frameworks and guidance documents  based on knowledge products stemming from projects, to participation in  training programs.  
Some  projects led to improvements in the health care system, ranging from the adoption  of professional standards, practices, and policies, to more physicians with  rural and remote experience. However, evidence was limited on the impacts of  these changes. Several of the projects that were able to demonstrate progress  towards longer-term outcomes were continuations of previously funded projects,  sometimes with multiple earlier phases.
Areas  for Consideration
 Given that the HCPCP continues to implement  program redesign, this evaluation presents areas for consideration that the  program can continue to build upon or take into account as it moves forward,  rather than providing recommendations. 

At  the project level, collaboration with relevant partner organizations and strong  project leadership were seen to be the most crucial elements for ultimate  project success, along with longer-term contribution agreements, evidence-based  planning, and support from Health Canada (i.e., encouraging buy-in from  stakeholders, and providing project guidance and advice).   
At  the program level, the evaluation identified Health Canada's role in knowledge  translation and strategic direction as areas for improvement, including use of  project performance and progress reports and following up on completed projects to  better determine the achievement of longer-term outcomes, as well as program  support for innovative projects.

1.0 Evaluation  purpose
The  purpose of the evaluation was to assess the relevance and effectiveness of the Health  Care Policy Contribution Program (HCPCP) for the period of 2013-14 to 2017-18.  The evaluation was required by the Financial Administration Act (FAA) and the  Treasury Board of Canada's Policy on Results (2016). 
2.0 Program  Description
Launched  in 2002, the HCPCP is a national program that provides contribution funding to  projects that address health care system priorities. The HCPCP is managed by  the Health Care Programs and Policy Directorate of Health Canada's Strategic Policy  Branch. 
The  HCPCP was developed as one of several mechanisms to address issues identified by  the Standing Senate Committee on Social Affairs, Science and Technology, and  the Commission on the Future of Health Care in Canada in 2002. The HCPCP also  aimed to address health care system priorities, as identified in the First  Ministers' 2003 Accord on Health Care Renewal and the First Ministers' 10 Year  Plan to Strengthen Health Care (2004), often referred to collectively as the  Health Accords.
The  HCPCP is intended to support the Government of Canada's role in health care by  supporting the development of policies and strategies to address evolving  health care system priorities. The HCPCP is based on a theory of change,  including the concept of knowledge translation, which is the active process of  synthesizing, disseminating, exchanging, and implementing knowledge to  ultimately improve the health of Canadians.  
During  the timeframe of the evaluation, the HCPCP funded projects through three  components: 1) the Health Human Resource Strategy; 2) the Internationally  Educated Health Professionals Initiative (IEHPI); and, 3) the Health Care  System Innovation Fund. Funding recipients included provincial and territorial (PT)  governments, and non-governmental organizations (NGO), such as educational  institutions and not-for-profit organizations (see table below).

There  were a number of reasons for the differences between planned and actual  expenditures over the period of the evaluation, including the following: 

extended timelines required to establish contribution  agreements with PTs; 
the underspending of funds by some recipients under  the IEHPI, as well as the winding down of this initiative starting in 2015-16;  and 
the realignment of the program to identify and address  new priorities, which started in 2013 and was ongoing at the time of the  evaluation.

3.0 Evaluation  Description
The  scope of this evaluation covered the period from 2013-14 to 2017-18, and  included all activities under the HCPCP. Given that program redesign activities  were undertaken concurrently with the evaluation, the evaluation was calibrated  and focused on meeting FAA requirements, including the examination of the core  issues of relevance and effectiveness, while also exploring factors that  contributed to or impeded program success. The questions below guided the evaluation. 
Relevance

1. How has  the program evolved over time to meet demonstrated needs/changing priorities?

Effectiveness

2. What progress has the HCPCP made in achieving its  expected outcomes?
3. What  elements or factors have contributed to, or impeded, project and/or program  successes?

 Data for the evaluation was collected using  various methods, including the following: 

A focused literature review; 
A document review that included an in-depth review of  10 project files. A cross-section of projects were selected by taking into  consideration the year, funding component, and value of the contribution  agreements. There was also a focus on projects that were completed or that had  been underway for several years;
Key informant interviews that included nine  interviewees (five internal and four external); and
Case studies of two projects:
  
The Community-Integrated Palliative Care Initiative:  The Way Forward, which included an in-depth review of project files and two key  informant interviews (one external and one internal).
The National Assessment Collaboration Practice Ready  Assessment (PRA) for International Medical Graduates in Canada, which included  an in-depth review of project files and three key informant interviews (two  external and one internal). 


The key limitations that this evaluation faced were a lack of collated performance  information, minimal data on long-term impacts, and a limited methodology. In  addition, the majority of outcome data was self-reported by the projects or consultants  contracted by the projects. To respond to these limitations, the evaluation  used multiple lines of evidence to gather a variety of perspectives from within  Health Canada and from funding recipients. Documentary evidence at both the  program and project levels was included. Due to the number of project files  reviewed (12 in total), results are not representative of all HCPCP projects. As  a result, illustrative examples are provided rather than reporting proportions  of projects. 
4.0 Findings
4.1 Relevance – How has the program evolved over time to meet demonstrated needs/changing  priorities?
The evaluation found  that HCPCP priorities have evolved over time and that there are continuing  needs within the health care system related to current priority areas, including palliative care, home care, mental health, and health care  system innovation.   
Evolution of  Priorities
 During  the timeframe covered by the evaluation, the HCPCP funded projects through  three program components: the Health Human Resource Strategy (HHRS), the IEHPI,  and the Health Care System Innovation Fund (HCSIF). These components were based  on priority areas stemming from federal commitments made in the 2003 and 2004  Health Accords.
The previous evaluation of the HCPCP noted  that, with the expiration of the Health Accords in 2014, the program would be  at a “watershed moment without a similar statement of federal priorities to  guide future health care contribution funding”Footnote 1.  In anticipation of the Health Accords ending, the HCPCP initiated an exercise aimed  at refocusing policy and funding priorities, and redesigning the comprehensive  operational framework and management approach for the programFootnote 2. Program representatives  developed a detailed Project Charter to guide the redesign process. This process  took into account a wide variety of issues and information, including:

emerging Government of Canada       health care policy priorities; 
provincial and territorial government priorities;
other national stakeholder perspectives (including the Health Council of Canada, the Canadian Medical       Association and Canadian Nursing Association, the College of Family       Physicians of Canada, and the Canadian Federation of Nursing); and
expert reportsFootnote 3.

In  2015, the following policy areas were confirmed as HCPCP priorities: High Users  of Health Care, System Adaptation to Needs of Aging Population, Optimizing the  Health Work Force, and Supporting Changing Role of Patients. The HCPCP  continued to fund projects under the three existing program components, although  the new priorities were used for project selectionFootnote 4. 
The HCPCP priorities were updated again in  2017 to reflect key areas identified in the Common Statement of Principles on  Shared Health Priorities. The program also considered other government programs  in order to help prevent overlap and ensure complementarityFootnote 5.  According to the most recent Health Canada Departmental Plan, current HCPCP  priorities include health care system innovation, as well as palliative and  end-of-life care. In addition, other program documentation and internal key  informants cited home care and mental health as priorities. To support these  priorities, the 2018 Call for Proposals objectives were to:  

optimize the health, well-being, and functional  independence of home care clients; 
promote the integration of community mental health  services with primary care; and 
improve access to palliative and end-of-life care.

The  HCSIF component is now the primary funding stream for HCPCP projects, due to  the sunsetting of the IEHPI component. According to internal key informants, a  decision was made to exclude PTs from the current Call for Proposals due, in  part, to the fact that PTs will be receiving $11 billion over ten years under  the Common Statement of Principles on Shared Health Priorities for commitments  related to home care and mental health. Several key informants also noted  challenges in managing projects with Provincial/Territorial (PT) recipients  given delays associated with approval processes within multiple bureaucracies  that led to lapsing of funds. It is worth noting that, while PTs were not  eligible for the 2018 Call for Proposals, they remain eligible funding  recipients under the program's Terms and Conditions and it is possible that they  will be recipients again in the future.
Evidence  of Need
 Documents  and literature reviewed as part of this evaluation found that there are  continuing needs within the health care system related to current HCPCP  priority areas, including palliative care, home care, mental health, and health  care system innovation. 
In  terms of home care and palliative care, there is evidence that there are unmet  needs for Canadians. For example, a recent study found that during a 12-month  period, 2.2 million Canadians received help or care at home due to a long-term  health condition, disability, or a problem related to aging, with seniors being  the most likely to receive care at home. Approximately 15% of those who  received home care did not receive all the help needed, and nearly half a  million Canadians who needed help or care for a chronic health condition in the  12 previous months did not receive itFootnote 6.  Another study found that almost half of all adult cancer deaths in Canada (45%)  happen in acute care hospitals, though many people would have benefited from  palliative care at home or in hospicesFootnote 7.
Furthermore,  given that the population in Canada is aging (with people aged 85 years and  over making up the fastest growing age group in Canada, and for the first time,  there are more people aged 65 and older than there are children aged 0-14  years)Footnote 8, these unmet needs are  likely to increase. 
With  regard to mental health, a significant number of Canadians are affected by poor  mental health and mental illness. According to the Canadian Mental Health  Association, in any given year, one in five people in Canada will personally  experience a mental health problem or illness, and mental illness indirectly  affects all Canadians at some time through a family member, friend, or  colleagueFootnote 9.  Another study concluded that gaps in mental health services continue to exist,  and that policy and practice solutions are needed to address unmet needsFootnote 10.
A  recent advisory panel highlighted the need for health system innovation by indicating  that federal action was important to promote innovation and enhance both the  quality and sustainability of Canadian health careFootnote 11.  The need for innovation has also been emphasized through recent Government of  Canada budgetsFootnote 12,Footnote 13,Footnote 14 and in the Common  Statement of Principles on Shared Health PrioritiesFootnote 15. 
Although  the Canadian Medication Incident Reporting and Prevention System (CMIRPS)  Program does not fall within the identified priority areas, it is an HCPCP  project that receives ongoing funding. As a result, the evaluation examined  evidence related to this project, and found that there is a continuing need. For  example, the World Health Organization indicated that medication errors are a  global issueFootnote 16, and a recent study found  that harmful events associated with medications (including getting the wrong  medication) occurred frequently during Canadian hospital staysFootnote 17. The University Health  Network indicated that preventable medical errors killed more than 30,000  Canadians in 2014, which means that preventable deaths occurring in acute care  kill more Canadians than stroke, diabetes, Alzheimer's, and kidney disease  combinedFootnote 18.
4.2 Effectiveness  – What progress has the HCPCP made in achieving its expected outcomes?
4.2.1 Stakeholders  are aware of knowledge products/tools
Projects were  generally effective in producing and disseminating knowledge products. Direct  measurement of awareness was limited, although there was other evidence related  to awareness, including the involvement of some target audiences in knowledge  product development, and subsequent use of some knowledge products. 
Overall, projects examined as part of the  evaluation were successful in producing planned knowledge products. However, some  projects were behind schedule and, at the time of their final progress reports,  a small number of projects had not produced all deliverables as planned. A  variety of knowledge products developed, including the following:

frameworks, standards and guidelines on health care  system approaches; 
recommendations and guides for specific health care  issues; 
accreditation standards and processes; 
environmental scans and discussion documents; 
data on medical incidents, safety bulletins, and  recommendations regarding medication safety; 
training enhancements, learning modules, and learning  supports; 
assessment tools; and 
formalized knowledge networks. 

Projects  disseminated knowledge products using a wide variety of mechanisms including  webinars, workshops, meetings, newsletters, networks, engagement sessions,  virtual forums, Twitter, Facebook, email lists, and conference presentations, booths,  and posters. Some projects measured the type and number of outreach and  dissemination activities, including access, and provided figures in their  progress reports related to these activities. There was little overall or rolled-up  data, although a few projects did measure reach. For example, the Health Force  Integration Research and Education for Internationally Educated Health  Professionals (IEHPs) project, which aimed to accelerate and expand the  assessment and integration of IEHPs, reported that it had reached “a large  audience of IEHPs (1,408 client outreach encounters) and organizations (1,850 organization  outreach encounters)”Footnote 19. No trend analysis was  available for any of the projects.   
Measurement  of awareness of knowledge products was limited. A few projects did not include  ‘awareness' as part of their outcome statements or objectives, so measurement  of awareness would not have been expected for those projects. Some project  progress reports indicated that they had intended to raise target audience  awareness, and that awareness had been measured; however, supporting  information did not necessarily provide a measure of awareness. For example,  one project reported the result of “stakeholders continue to be engaged”, while  another reported “overall satisfaction with both content and delivery modules  was high”, both without further explanation or information on awareness. 
Available data on awareness included the  following: 

The  Way Forward project, which was intended to help move the health system towards  a community-integrated approach to palliative and end-of-life care, measured  target audience awareness, as well as disseminating discussion documents and  the National Framework: A Roadmap for an Integrated Palliative Approach to Care.  They found that 96% of respondents were aware of the discussion documents. For  the Framework, 88% of respondents had read it. In addition, participants at a  2013 workshop were asked if their understanding of an integrated palliative  approach to care increased after the workshop and 60% gave a rating of 4 or 5,  while 34% gave a rating of 3 (where 1 is not at all and 5 is significantly)Footnote 20.
The  Future of Medical Education in Canada Postgraduate Project aimed to develop  smoother and more effective transitions from medical school to residency, and  from residency into clinical practice. The project-level evaluation found that,  on average, 69% of respondents were aware of projects related to transitions  from residency to clinical practice, with awareness levels ranging from 31% for  one initiative to 100% for anotherFootnote 21. 

The collaborative nature of projects meant  that for some, key players involved in the project were also among the target  audience for the project. As such, they were aware of the knowledge products. For  example: 

The  Way Forward was led by the Canadian Hospice Palliative Care Association and the  Quality End-of-Life Care Coalition of Canada (which is made up of 34 member  organizations), and included other stakeholders including federal, provincial  and territorial governments, policymakers, health care professionals, home care  associations, primary/acute care and long-term care associations, and  organizations representing Canada's First Nations. 
The  National Assessment Collaboration Practice Ready Assessment (PRA) for  International Medical Graduates project aimed to develop a pan-Canadian process  to assess International Medical Graduates' readiness for practice under  provisional licensure. A steering committee that included medical regulatory  authorities, certification colleges, the Federation of Medical Regulatory  Authorities of Canada, and the Medical Council of Canada led the project. The  project also had working groups for areas of medical speciality (e.g., family  medicine, psychiatry, internal medicine), and included stakeholders  representing PRA programs, PT Ministries of Health, the Association of  Faculties of Medicine in Canada, and the Canadian Medical Association. The  final project report indicated that “programs were engaged in all  prioritization, design, and research and development activities. By engaging  programs in the creation of standards, knowledge transfer was increased  regarding what the standards meant.”Footnote 22

Also  of note is that awareness is a prerequisite to uptake/use, and many projects  examined as part of this evaluation were able to demonstrate use of some of the  knowledge products they had produced (see Section 4.2.2, below).   
4.2.2 Stakeholders  are using knowledge products/tools
The evaluation found  evidence that some target audiences were using knowledge products stemming from  projects. Use varied, ranging from the development of frameworks and guidance  documents based on knowledge products, to participation in training programs.  
Given  that not all knowledge products had been produced or finalized at the time of  project reporting, evidence of use is limited to some knowledge products only.  However, many progress reports, project evaluations, and final project reports  included information on uptake and use of knowledge products by the target  audiences. Examples of use ranged from using frameworks and resources, to  participating in family medicine training programs.
Several  project reports included evidence that was vague or non-specific and appeared  to be based on informal input from stakeholders. For example, evidence of use  in one project report was, “report used by various stakeholders to inform  policy discussions”, while another project report indicated, “anecdotal  evidence and monitoring program changes”. 
However, more concrete evidence of use was  available for many projects. The case study of The Way Forward found that, in  2017, members of the Quality End-of-Life Care Coalition and PT representatives  were surveyed to assess uptake and use of The Way Forward's knowledge products,  including the National Framework: A Roadmap for an Integrated Palliative  Approach to Care. Eighty-nine percent of Quality End-of-Life Care Coalition  respondents and 83% of PT respondents indicated that they had used the National  Framework for guidanceFootnote 23. Specific examples of  the use of knowledge products from The Way Forward included: 

Nova  Scotia used an early iteration of the National Framework to assist in the development  of a draft provincial framework. 
The  Ontario Palliative Care Steering Committee used the discussion documents and  Framework as input into their palliative care work. 
Ontario  used the framework and quality indicators discussion document to inform the  provincial “Declaration of Partnership” table to develop performance indicators  for Ontario. 
Alberta  used the framework and survey results to inform their provincial steering  committee activities.       

For  the Future of Medical Education in Canada Postgraduate Project, the project  evaluation reported that three colleges (College of Family Physicians of  Ontario, Collège des médicins du Québec and Royal College of Physicians and  Surgeons of Canada) had begun realignment of their Postgraduate Medical Education  accreditation standards at the time of the project evaluationFootnote 24.
 Evidence  was also available for the Choosing Wisely Canada project, a campaign aimed at  helping clinicians and patients engage in conversations about unnecessary tests  and treatments, and make smart and effective care choices. Two practical  toolkits from Choosing Wisely Canada were used by hospitals and one was used in  a randomized trial:  

Give  the Test a Rest, a toolkit for reducing unnecessary emergency department lab  testing, was used by North York General Hospital. 
Less  is More with T3 and T4, a toolkit on reducing free thyroid hormone testing, was  used by Women's College Hospital. 
Drowsy  Without Feeling Lousy, a toolkit for de-prescribing of benzodiazepines and  other sedative hypnotics in primary care, was used in a cluster randomized  trial in Montreal that engaged patients at various pharmacies. 

The  National Assessment Collaboration PRA for International Medical Graduates  project reported that, “Coupled with their [stakeholder] involvement in common  material development, the adoption of these materials into current practices  increased. In addition to the programs' in-kind support of the initiative with  their commitment of professional time, they shared materials and tools that  were adopted and/or adapted for use across programs and now reside in the  resource library.”Footnote 25
The  evaluation examined two Family Medicine Residencies Initiatives (FMRI) projects  that aimed to enhance training for family medicine residents in rural and  underserved areas, one in Newfoundland and one in Nunavut. Use, in the context  of these projects, was participation in the training programs. Overall, the two  projects supported the training of 44 residents. One project was slightly below  its target number of residents trained, as no residents were trained in the  first year, reportedly due to the timing of receipt of initial funding from  Health Canada. The second project was above their target number of residents  trained; however, this was due to more residents being sent to the training site  for shorter periods of time, rather than having a smaller number of residents  at the sites for longer periods, as had been planned.  
A few internal and external interview  respondents indicated that Health Canada is a user of the knowledge products  created by some projects. For example: 

Data  from the Canadian Post-Medical Doctor Education Registry (CAPER), which  provides longitudinal data on the numbers and types of physicians moving  through Canada's postgraduate medical training system, has been used by Health  Canada for a health workforce program and by the Federal/Provincial/Territorial  Committee on Health Workforce for resource planning. 
Health  Canada has used knowledge products from CMIRPS and worked with the Institute  for Safe Medication Practices Canada (ISMP) to develop guidance on a naming  policy for drugs, as well as for labelling and packaging of prescription and  non-prescription drugs, and natural health products. 
Health  Canada is currently using knowledge products from The Way Forward to inform  legislative work and the federal strategy on palliative care. 

4.2.3 Improvements  in the health care system
There is evidence  that some projects led to improvements in the health care system, ranging from the  adoption of professional standards, practices, and policies, to more physicians  with rural/remote experience. However, evidence is limited on the impacts of  these changes. It is notable that several projects that were able to  demonstrate progress towards longer-term outcomes were continuations of  previously funded projects, sometimes with multiple earlier phases. 
Of  the projects reviewed, the average contribution agreement length was  approximately three years. As a result, some final project reports and  evaluation reports had limited evidence on the achievement of longer-term  outcomes. Those that ended several years ago might only now be demonstrating  impacts at the system level; however, although Health Canada had permission to  revisit the achievement of longer-term outcomes two to three years after  project completion (as per a question in the progress reporting template that  was required for most projects examined by the evaluation), there was no  evidence that this has been done. Several internal key informants identified  this as an area the program should focus on for improvement. However, the progress  reporting template (developed by the Office of Grants and Contributions) has  been updated and no longer includes such a question. This could present a  challenge if Health Canada wanted to follow up on the longer-term results of  projects in the future. HCPCP representatives indicated that they will look  into this issue further to see if there are ways to strengthen recipient  reporting on achievement of outcomes and impacts over the long-term, beyond the  funding period of the project. A few internal key informants also noted that  projects funded over a shorter period do not necessarily go beyond the output  or immediate outcome level. Furthermore, they noted that, given the overall  amount of funding for projects relative to overall health care system funding,  it is very challenging to measure the specific impact of projects. 
There  was, however, evidence of health care system improvements for some projects. Of  note is that a number of projects examined as part of the evaluation were  continuations of earlier projects funded by the HCPCP; for example, CMIRPS, the  National Assessment Collaboration PRA for International Medical Graduates,  Choosing Wisely Canada, and Pour une meilleure intégration au Québec des  médecins diplômés hors du Canada et des États-Unis. For these projects,  evidence of longer-term results may have been, at least in part, the result of  work that was started many years earlier. For example, the case study of the  National Assessment Collaboration PRA, found that the project was able to  demonstrate changes to the health care system in terms of additional health  care practitioners with provisional licensure. The project reported that in  2016 and 2017, 428 individuals succeeded in obtaining provisional licensure  through a harmonized PRA, at both a lower cost and in a shorter timeframe than  traditional residency. At the same time, one of the other key objectives of the  PRA was that internationally educated physicians would be “safe and competent”  to practice in Canada. However, data was unavailable as to whether patient  safety improved as a result. 
For the CMIRPS project, a recent case study  conducted by an independent contractor noted that the best example of uptake was  when ISMP Canada recommendations and medication safety products and tools have influenced  professional standards. Accreditation standards require compliance, so ISMP  Canada's influence has system-wide effects when its medication safety  recommendations and strategies are incorporated into these standards. In 2016,  ISMP confirmed that 72 recommendations from incident analyses continued to be  included in Accreditation Standards and Required Organizational Practices. For  example, Accreditation Canada's Required Organizational Practices handbook for  2014 includes two topics that relate to ISMP Canada's work on opioids. Additional  examples of health care system improvements stemming from CMIRPS include:

New  Ontario College of Pharmacists ‘Community Pharmacy Assessment Criteria', which  helps ensure pharmacies have operational processes in place to ensure safety, and  includes two criteria that direct the user to CMIRPS safety bulletins (2018). 
Good  Label and Package Practices Guides for both Prescription Drugs, and  Non-Prescription Drugs and Natural Health Products, which provide industry with  direction on how to comply with the new requirements set out as part of the  Plain Language Labelling Regulations, and have contributed to changes in  packaging and labelling (2017). 
Acceptable  Abbreviations for Prescription Health Product Labels in Canada, which creates  consistency in the use of select abbreviations on prescription health product  labels in Canada (2017).
Physician  order forms integrating recommendations from a Safety Bulletin from CMIRPS that  indicates to prescribers the abbreviations not to use and abbreviations that  can be used when writing orders (2017). 
Canadian  Incident Analysis Framework (CIAF), co-authored by ISMP in 2012, is a resource  to help support individual and organizational learning, as well as quality  improvement, in response to patient safety incidents. Although the development  of the CIAF was outside the scope of this evaluation, it was considered given  that implementation of the framework is ongoing. An evaluation undertaken by  the Canadian Patient Safety Institute in 2017 highlighted the effects of the  CIAFFootnote 26.  It found that of the organizations that had used the CIAF, a large proportion  had made changes to practices, policies or procedures, and most reported that  this had impacted patient safety substantially or moderately. Users of the CIAF  reported changes in a variety of areas such as investigating patient incidents,  developing actions in response to incidents, reporting patient safety events,  communicating with patients about safety events, and involving patients in  reporting and investigations. 

Choosing Wisely Canada is another project  that demonstrated longer-term results. As of October 2017, the project reported  61 instances of reductions in unnecessary tests and treatments, stemming from  resources produced by the projectFootnote 27. Examples  include:  

Using  the approach in the ‘Give the Test a Rest' toolkit, North York General Hospital  in Ontario achieved a 23% reduction in lab testing over two years.
Using  the approach in the ‘Less is More with T3 and T4' toolkit, Women's College Hospital  reduced free thyroid hormone testing by 54%.
The  Cumming School of Medicine reported that for one intervention, “a 4% reduction  in test ordering was observed post-intervention equating to $4,600 in annual  savings with a projected provincial savings of $40,000 for all emergency  departments in Alberta.” 
McGill  University Health Centre reported that for one intervention, “the average cost  per admitted patient decreased from $117 to $66, with an estimated savings of  $50,657 over 985 admissions. After adjusting for fiscal period and the presence  of our intervention, there was a significant reduction in the per-patient  number of total tests, complete blood counts, and electrolyte panels performed.  Length of stay decreased during the intervention to five days from seven days.”

The  Way Forward project conducted a follow-up survey in 2017 and found that, in nine  of the 12 jurisdictions who responded to the survey, there is now a provincial  policy framework for hospice palliative care, supported by strategies for  training and skills development of health care providers (in BC, AB, SK, MB,  ON, NS, PEI, NWT, and YK)Footnote 28. 
The  two FMRI projects reviewed as part of this evaluation led to additional  physicians with rural/remote experience. Memorial University's Family Medicine  Residency Program produced 16 family medicine graduates with rural/remote  training over the project's duration. The project-level evaluation found that  54% of graduates went into rural practice, with five graduates returning to  practice in the community in which they were trained, or in nearby communities,  and with two graduates signing long-term contracts. However, it also noted that  as the two pilot sites constituted a small proportion of the province's  population, there was no observable impact on physician recruitment to  rural/remote areas of NewfoundlandFootnote 29. The Nunavut  Family Medicine Residencies Project produced 28 additional residents with  rural/remote experience. However, eight trainees were meant to have a “return  of service” commitment of two yearsFootnote 30, and only two  graduates appear to have signed contracts (one for one year and another for  three years)Footnote 31. 
The  FMRI was the only program area to have been reviewed internally by the program.  This 2015 review found that the FMRI was successful in increasing residency  spots and/or  meeting the needs of the  jurisdictions, estimating that 144 of the targeted 145 residency spots had been  created, thus improving access to health care, especially in underserved areas.  However, the review noted that, while the results were positive and were  generally in line with the contribution agreements, it was difficult to  ascertain the impact of federal funding on achieving these results, because  some of the FMRI projects were part of larger initiatives by the PTs to address  rural and remote physician recruitment and retention. In some cases, the PTs  also funded residents as part of the project and they reported on all the  activities, rather than just those that were federally funded.  
4.3 Effectiveness:  What elements/factors have contributed to or  impeded project success?
The evaluation  identified several areas that contributed to or impeded the success of  projects, including collaboration, project leadership, and the length of the  contribution agreements. In many cases, the same factor was seen to be either  an impediment or contributor, depending on the situation or perspective. 
A  number of themes emerged for factors that contributed to or impeded project  success. The evaluation focused on factors that all projects could learn from,  rather than on those that would only be relevant to extremely similar projects.  Key themes are described below. Collaboration
  The  importance of collaboration with relevant partner organizations throughout  project planning and implementation was the most often cited issue in final project  reports, evaluations, project progress reports and by external key informants,  as well as by a majority of internal key informants. In some projects,  collaborative activities were said to have slowed or impeded progress, but ultimately  collaboration was seen to be the most crucial element for project success. Issues  related to collaboration included the importance of engaging a wide variety of  perspectives and disciplines, building strong relationships with relevant  stakeholders, including through face-to-face interactions, and transparent  communication. 
Project  leadership
  The  theme of project leadership was the factor cited by the largest number of  internal key informants and a large number of external key informants as either  contributing to or impeding success, depending on the effectiveness of the  leadership. Issues related to leadership included the importance of the organization  leading the project having:  a dedicated  project leader or team, governance structures in place, and adequate capacity,  in terms of time and knowledge or experience.  
Length and  flexibility of contribution agreements
  There  was general agreement among internal and external key informants that longer-term  contribution agreements better enabled project success, while shorter-term contribution  agreements were an impediment to success. Virtually all internal and external  key informants who commented on the length of contribution agreements indicated  that a five-year agreement would be ideal. In addition, a few key informants  noted that a multi-phased approach to contribution agreements for projects that  demonstrate success would lead to better results. The potential for greater  innovation with longer-term contribution agreements was also noted in one  project report, and by a few internal key informants. In addition to contribution  agreement length, several external key informants and a few project progress  reports indicated that increased flexibility in contribution agreements would  be preferable, for example, to allow recipients more discretion in the timing  of spending.    
Evidence-based  planning
  A  number of project reports and many external key informants discussed issues  related to the availability of evidence for planning. They cited lack of  relevant evidence as an impediment for some projects. However, several projects  overcame this obstacle by undertaking research and environmental scans to  address gaps in knowledge and to improve planning for the projects as they  moved forward. A clear project plan with defined objectives/outcomes was seen as  important for project success, in particular by internal key informants. Finally,  a few external key informants discussed the value of using lessons learned or  evaluation findings to inform future planning. 
HCPCP  input  
  According  to a few external and internal key informants, engagement with HCPCP staff to  align projects with program or broader Health Canada priorities/needs was a  success factor for some projects, as this helped ensure they were relevant and  useful. In addition, several external key informants, many project progress  reports, and one final project report noted that HCPCP involvement and support  were helpful for projects. Examples include encouraging buy-in from  stakeholders and providing project guidance and advice. However, a number of  project progress reports indicated that Health Canada could do more information  sharing, such as with other HCPCP project activities and lessons learned. 
4.4 Effectiveness:  What elements/factors have contributed to or  impeded program success?
Re-centralizing the  HCPCP and support from the Office of Grants and Contributions were identified  as the key factors contributing to program success. The program's role in  knowledge translation and strategic direction, including use of project  performance and progress reports, as well as program support for innovative  projects, were identified as areas for improvement.
A  few key themes emerged as factors that have affected success at the program  level. These are described below.      
Program  Structure and Support
 A  few internal key informants talked about the structure of the HCPCP, indicating  that re-centralization of the HCPCP in 2016 was a positive move for the program.  These key informants saw re-centralization as a key factor in improving the  consistency of program delivery and for consolidating both project and program  management. As part of re-centralization, the HCPCP redesigned its strategic  plan and direction and made changes to business processes to help ensure  management integrity and consistency. This included updating governance  processes, identifying new policy priorities that aligned with ministerial  priorities, and approving new Terms and Conditions. The program designed a Call  for Proposals to align with new priorities and expand the reach of the program  to recipients across the country. To deliver on the Call for Proposals, new  business processes and tools were developed and implemented. Program  representatives indicated that the program placed an emphasis on performance  measurement and provided support to recipients to help ensure accountabilities were  met and deliverables achieved. In addition, they indicated that there will be a  lessons learned exercise following the completion of the Call for Proposals  process to provide an opportunity to review and improve program management  practices.
The  Office of Grants and Contributions is a Health Canada group tasked with improving  performance measurement and knowledge translation within a number of grants and  contributions programs. Many internal key informants cited the Office as an  important support for program success, because they are able to provide  assistance and advice to the program and funding recipients regarding issues  such as performance measurement and evaluation. Many external key informants and  project progress reports also mentioned the value of the workshops that the Office  of Grants and Contributions delivered (discussed further below). 
Program Role in  Knowledge Translation and Strategic Direction 
 The  program's role in knowledge translation and strategic direction emerged as an  area for improvement. Most internal key informants highlighted the underuse of  project performance information, with some indicating that its use should be increased  in order to improve knowledge translation and to inform policy development and  the identification of strategic priorities and investments. 
  Progress  reporting is mandatory for all projects funded by the HCPCP, although specific  requirements are based on risk, which, according to program representatives, is  assessed annually, as per the corporate risk tolerance strategy. For example,  high-risk projects may require quarterly reporting, while lower-risk projects  may only require annual reporting, and final evaluation reports are only required  for some projects. However, the evaluation found issues with the information  contained in some of the progress reports, including incomplete reporting and a  lack of verifiable information related to outcomes. Furthermore, the program  did not appear to be systematically tracking the reporting requirements of the  various projects, for example, into a shared database. 
In addition, there was only very limited  evidence of the program collating findings from project evaluations and project  progress reports. This could be used to report on outcomes in strategic  planning, or to identify themes for lessons learned and best practices, both at  the project level and in regard to Health Canada support. The FMRI, which  included nine projects over the period 2009-10 to 2016-17, was the only instance  of the program collating project reporting. For this set of projects, the program  used project progress reports, project evaluations, and other relevant project  documents in order to assess the following: 

activities conducted in relation to contribution  agreements; 
results achievement; 
plans for sustainability post-Health Canada funding; 
best practices; and 
lessons learned. 

Draft  versions of the report and a related two-page summary document were provided for  this evaluation, although it was not clear whether they were finalized or how  the program used them.  
Several  external key informants commented on the project reporting templates,  indicating that they were generally comfortable with them, although they were  time-consuming. Some project progress reports also provided suggestions for  changes to the template, such as streamlining the questions and having some  questions only included in annual or final progress reporting. One interviewee  questioned what Health Canada had done with the information from the reports,  particularly given the time invested by the recipients in completing it, and  one final project report indicated that the templates were difficult to work  with and that, although Health Canada had asked for feedback, it did not seem  to use it. 
One  area where the program did appear to have taken on a knowledge translation role  was in offering sessions or workshops to funding recipients. According to  program representatives, the sessions were primarily offered to Health Canada  staff and funding recipients working under the IEHPI, although based on  external key informant feedback, the audience also included project recipients  funded under HHRS and HCSIF. Program representatives indicated that the Office  of Grants and Contributions organized most of the sessions, following requests  from the program. Recent examples include a session entitled “Moving Knowledge  into Practice, Programs and Policy in the Context of Grants and Contributions”  on October 5, 2017 and a Performance Measurement Learning Event on February 13,  2018. Many external key informants and project progress reports mentioned these  sessions as being positive and supportive. Recipients saw the sessions, along  with annual meetings, as good opportunities for knowledge translation and  learning about specific subjects, such as performance measurement and evaluation,  and gender-based analysis. Recipients also saw these as opportunities for communicating  with other funding recipients. 
Beyond  the provision of such sessions, there was little evidence of the program taking  on a proactive role in knowledge translation. Several external key informants  and project progress reports, as well as one final project report, noted that  the program could improve its strategic direction and contribution to knowledge  translation. Suggestions for improvement included funding projects that were  explicitly designed to be shared and replicated across the country, and being  more strategic and timely with sharing information on other projects to help  prevent duplication and encourage learning. Several internal key informants  shared these views, indicating that the program could be less operational and  more strategic if it improved knowledge translation and exchange, provided more  leadership, and shared information such as project results. A few internal key  informants also suggested that the program should develop a knowledge  translation strategy. 
This  focus on knowledge translation and use of performance information is consistent  with the theory of change upon which the program design is based. A key feature  of this theory is feedback and learning loops between inputs, activities,  outputs, and outcomes. The loops indicate opportunities when performance  information can be used to improve the likelihood that the outcomes will be  achievedFootnote 32. 
Encouraging  Innovation
 A  few internal key informants suggested that the program could do more to  encourage innovation, citing what they perceive to be a risk-averse approach to  project selection as something that stifles innovation. They suggested that the  program should help test and build the evidence base by funding more innovative  projects. 
5.0 Conclusions  and Areas for Consideration
5.1  Conclusions
HCPCP  priorities have evolved over time and there are continuing needs within the  health care system related to current priority areas, including palliative  care, home care, mental health, and health care system innovation.   
Projects  were generally effective in producing and disseminating knowledge products, and  there was evidence of progress towards all three program outcome areas. Although  direct measurement of awareness was limited, there was other evidence related  to awareness, including the involvement of some target audiences in knowledge  product development and subsequent use of some knowledge products. Use varied,  ranging from the development of frameworks and guidance documents based on  knowledge products, to participation in training programs.  
Some  projects led to improvements in the health care system, ranging from the adoption  of professional standards, practices and policies, to more physicians with  rural/remote experience. However, evidence was limited on the impacts of these  changes. It is notable that several projects that were able to demonstrate  progress towards longer-term outcomes were continuations of previously funded  projects, sometimes with multiple earlier phases.
5.2 Areas for Consideration
Given  that the HCPCP continues to implement program redesign, this evaluation  presents the following areas for consideration that the program can continue to  build upon or take into account as it moves forward, rather than providing  recommendations:

At  the project level, collaboration with relevant partner organizations and strong  project leadership were seen to be the most crucial elements for ultimate  project success, along with longer-term contribution agreements, evidence-based  planning, and support from Health Canada (i.e., encouraging buy-in from  stakeholders and providing project guidance and advice). 
At  the program level, Health Canada's role in knowledge translation and strategic  direction, including use of project performance and progress reports and  following up on completed projects to better determine the achievement of  longer-term outcomes, as well as program support for innovative projects, were  identified as areas for improvement.
