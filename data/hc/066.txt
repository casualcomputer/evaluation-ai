Results at a Glance - Evaluation of the Office of International Affairs for the Health Portfolio 

Introduction

The  Office of International Affairs (OIA) for the Health Portfolio conducts a range  of activities that can be categorized into three broad groups: global health  policy analysis, advice, and support; international relations and engagement;  and priority setting and strategic planning.
Between  April 2012 and March 2018, total expenditures for all OIA activities period  were approximately $97M. 

What the evaluation found

OIA’s  mandate is quite broad; however, it reflects the complexity of the work, and  many key informants and survey respondents agreed that the mandate was  appropriate and clear.  
While  most key informants had generally positive views of OIA’s products and  services, survey respondents’ views were mixed, especially with regards to OIA’s  global health policy analysis and advice, and its approach to information sharing  and intelligence gathering.
Governance mechanisms were found to be in place;  however, the Partnership Executive Committee International Affairs Working  Committee could have been functioning more effectively. Attendance at this ADM-VP  level committee was often delegated to other staff, and it appeared to be more  of an information-sharing body than one where strategic discussions took place. 
By  serving both Health Canada and the Public Agency of Canada through the shared  service model approach, OIA was seen as providing value to the coordination of  international activities for the Health Portfolio.   
Generally,  OIA’s relationships with the branches are seen as working well. Most key  informants stated that roles and responsibilities were well established when  the Minister or the deputy heads attended an event; however, they were less  clear when the issue was of a more technical nature. In addition, it was not  always clear which files OIA should lead, and which ones the program should  lead.
OIA  engages in a wide range of activities, and while it is difficult to determine  the impact of all of these activities, there is evidence of impact related to  the higher-profile activities (e.g., sitting as a member of the World Health  Executive Organization’s Executive Board and the Pan American Health  Organization’s Executive Committee). This impact includes supporting the  advancement of Canadian policy positions on international issues, and  identifying opportunities for Canadian leadership.  
Since  2014, OIA has been running a deficit. As its activities have increased, so too  has demand for resources. Even though OIA has been able to secure funds on an  ad hoc basis through special requests, this is potentially risky and is an  approach that may not be successful over the long term. 

Recommendations and responses

Clearly articulate roles and responsibilities  regarding international files, and communicate those within the Portfolio.
Response: OIA will strengthen its engagement with Health Portfolio  governance committees and develop and promote a more comprehensive suite of  communications products to clearly define and articulate OIA and program roles  and responsibilities, as well as OIA’s suite of services and products.
Further explore opportunities to improve products and services.
Response: OIA will continue to identify  opportunities for feedback to guide improvement of products and services. In  addition, OIA will provide learning opportunities for Health Portfolio  counterparts to increase knowledge of international affairs and build capacity  in this area to help improve the products developed.
Explore ways to measure the impact of OIA activities.
Response: OIA will  assess the feasibility of measuring the impact of OIA’s activities as a shared  service. 

About the evaluation
The evaluation assessed  the design of OIA and the delivery of its activities as a shared service, focusing  on activities conducted from April 2012 to September 2017. Methods used to collect  data to address the  evaluation questions included a review of the literature, program files and documents,  and financial data, as well as a client survey, key informant interviews, and  comparative analyses.
