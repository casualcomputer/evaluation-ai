Internal Audit and Program Evaluation Reports - 2016
External Assessment of the CRA Internal Audit Function
Since 2002, internationally recognized internal audit standards require that an external assessment of the CRA’s Internal Audit Function be performed at least once every five years. This is to assess how activities of internal audit function comply with the Institute of Internal Audit (IIA) standards and improve the organization's operations. The CRA's previous external assessments of its internal audit function were completed in 2006 and in 2011. The CRA obtained the IIA’s highest possible rating (general conformance to the standards). In compliance with the IIA standards, an independent external assessment was completed in 2016, and again, the CRA has obtained the highest possible rating.
