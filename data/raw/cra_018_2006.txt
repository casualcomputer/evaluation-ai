Internal Audit and Program Evaluation Reports - 2006
Quality Assessment of CRA Internal Audit
Internationally recognized internal audit standards require that an external assessment be performed at least once every five years to appraise how activities comply with the standards and to improve the organization's operations. This requirement was introduced in 2002 with the expectation that the first external assessment would be completed no later than 2007. The CRA's first external assessment was completed in 2006. The CRA obtained the highest possible rating - general conformance to the standards.
