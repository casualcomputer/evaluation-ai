Launched in 2017 to 2018, the Union Training and Innovation Program aims to strengthen union-based apprenticeship training, innovation and enhanced partnerships in the Red Seal trades. The Program invested $127.4M through grants and contributions, to fund 217 projects via 2 funding streams:
Stream 1 - “Investments in Training Equipment,” to share with unions the cost of new, up-to-date equipment and materials that meet industry standards or investments in technology in the Red Seal trades; and
Stream 2 - “Innovation in Apprenticeship,” to support innovative approaches and enhanced partnerships to address challenges that limit apprenticeship outcomes
Approximately 24,300 participants attended the Program’s activities.
About this Evaluation
Evaluation coverage: from the Program’s inception in fiscal year 2017 to 2018 to fiscal year 2020 to 2021
Evaluation scope: Program’s design, implementation and early achievements
Lines of evidence: Key Informant Interviews, Document Review and the 2019 to 2020 Federal Apprenticeship Programs Survey
Key findings
The Program funding focused on projects that improved the quality of training, addressed barriers limiting participation and success in trades, and enhanced partnerships. Ontario had the largest number of funded projects, consistent with the fact that it has the largest number of union training centres
The Program exceeded the targeted number of participants for 2019 to 2020 by 24%. Of the 24,300 participants in projects funded since the inception, 26% are from key groups, 11% of whom are Black Canadians
The Program is meeting its expected outcomes: 95% of Program participants reported they are currently employed in a Red Seal trade; 16% of them are from key groups, of which 90% are Newcomers
Although performance framework was in place, there were limitations in performance measurement reporting
Recommendations
Improve the Program’s performance monitoring, data collection and performance records
Explore how other apprenticeship trainings could target regions where union involvement in training is less prevalent
