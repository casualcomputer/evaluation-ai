Executive summary
This report presents Phase 2 of the evaluation of the Opportunities Fund for Persons with Disabilities. Introduced in 1997, the program was designed to fill a gap in federal supports for persons with disabilities who are not eligible for the Employment Insurance program or training support under Employment Insurance Part II.
The first phase of the evaluation, published in September 2018, found that the Opportunities Fund provided persons with disabilities the ability to:
acquire or develop skills
obtain paid employment experience
obtain assistance to become self-employed
The second phase of the evaluation examines how the Opportunities Fund affects labour market outcomes for participants over a 5-year period, using net impact analysis. It also presents the results of a survey examining how the program:
addresses employer needs, and
increases employer awareness of the benefits of employing persons with a disability
Key findings
The following are the key findings that emerged from this evaluation:
overall, the Opportunities Fund had a positive and lasting impact on the labour market attachment of participants. Positive impacts were relatively larger for men
positive impacts are consistent across intervention types and demographic subgroups. This suggests that the program is helping people across a broad spectrum of characteristics
over the 5-year post-participation period, the average annual earnings of participants increased by 38% due to participation in the program. This translates to about $1,100 higher earnings than non-participants with similar characteristics
Skills for Employment and Wage Subsidy were the most effective interventions at improving participants’ employment opportunities and decreasing reliance on social assistance benefits
social assistance remained an important source of income for Opportunities Fund participants, both before and after participation in an Opportunities Fund intervention
preliminary
Footnote

findings suggest that, overall, the 2014 to 2015 reform appears promising. The reform has strengthened the impact of the Opportunities Fund on labour market attachments one year after participation
when taking into account costs and benefits for both governments and participants, the Opportunities Fund yielded a positive social return on investment over the 10 years, post-participation
from a societal perspective, benefits outweigh their associated costs in less than 4 years. Overall, $1 investment in Opportunities Fund program yields $1.7 in return over a 10-year period following the intervention
investing $1 in Skills For Employment yields $4.40 in return over 10 years following the intervention. This includes 5 years observed plus 5 years projected
employers see the program as useful in meeting their business needs and in increasing their awareness of persons with disabilities as employees
Recommendations
The program should examine the means by which the department can directly access employers participating in Opportunities Fund programming. This is for the purpose of evaluation and performance measurement. Explore different ways to collect more granular data on the Skills for Employment intervention. This would allow for an increased understanding of what elements contribute to changes in employment and employment earnings
Re-examine the 6-month limit placed on training programs as a result of the 2014 to 2015 program reforms. Given that the participants in the Skills for Employment intervention experienced a lower average income after the reforms than before, the preliminary evidence suggests that this decision may not have had its intended effect
Program background
The Opportunities Fund for Persons with Disabilities gives funding to support a range of projects. This is to ensure that eligible persons with disabilities can access the assistance needed to integrate or re-integrate into the labour market, Third-party organizations known as Community Coordinators design and deliver most projects. Community Coordinators, also referred to as funding or contribution recipients, act as intermediaries between participants and employers.
The program includes the following interventions as seen in Table 1.

questions Concerning Participants of the Opportunities Fund for Persons with Disability Program:
What are participants’ post-program economic and labour market outcomes after participating in the Opportunities Fund Disability Program interventions?
Which groups or sub-groups of participants benefit the most from their participation in the program?
How, and to what degree, does the program fit the needs of persons with disabilities?
To what extent have the program reforms contributed to improve participants’ post-program outcomes?
What are the overall socio-economic costs and benefits of the program?
questions Concerning Employers Who Participate in the Opportunities Fund for Persons with Disability Program:
Has the program increased awareness of the benefit of hiring persons with disabilities among employers?
How, and to what degree, does the program fit the needs of employers?
Profile of participants
The proportion of male participants relative to female was greater in the Opportunities Fund than in the Canadian population who have a disability. Opportunities Fund participants were notably younger compared to the working-age population with disabilities.

Labour market outcomes: Employment income
Overall, program participants increased their average employment income after participating in the program. The size of the increase varied by the type of intervention.
Examining trends in the 5 years prior to and after the intervention provides a compelling snapshot of the overall positive trend of all interventions on employment earnings. These results are based on participants only and do not refer to the net impact of the program
The Skills for Employment and Wage Subsidy shows the largest overall increase in employment income, compared to participants’ income one year prior to their interventions
Participants who received Skills for Employment interventions saw their income grow by an average annual increase of $7,177 (234%) compared to the year prior to participating in the intervention

Labour market outcomes: Employment
Overall, participants’ employment chances improved after participation in the program. Results vary by type of interventions and participants’ characteristics.
While all interventions led to an overall positive trend on employment for Opportunity Fund participants, the strongest positive trends were experienced by participants who received:
Work Experience
Skills for Employment, and
Wage Subsidy interventions
These outcomes are based on participants only and do not refer to the net impact of the program.
Growth in the proportion of participants employed before and after these interventions increased by 15 to 18 percentage points
For example, participants in the Wage Subsidy experienced an average annual increase of 15 percentage points (or 30%)

Net impact analysis
The Opportunities Fund had a positive impact on participants’ labour market attachments.
In general, any intervention from the Opportunities Fund was found to improve participants’ labour market attachment. During the 5-year period following their participation, the program led to an average annual:
increase of 5.47 percentage points in their incidence of employment
increase of $1,094 (38%) in their employment income
a decline of $41 (0.8%) in social assistance benefits

Net impact analysis: Employment income
Each intervention has a positive net impact on employment income with Skills for Employment having the most positive impact on earnings.
There is a positive net impact of the Opportunities Fund on employment income of $1,094, on average, over 5 years post-program. This is equal to a 38% increase from one year prior to the start of the intervention
Skills for Employment was the most effective for increasing employment income on average by $3,691 (120%) over 5 years post-program
The Wage Subsidy also had a positive, but lower, net impact at $2,163 (78%)
Enhanced Employment Assistance Services and Work Experience had the lowest impact at $526 (18%) and $744 (55%)

in employment among participants
The Wage Subsidy was the most effective, increasing the incidence of employment by 16.5 percentage points (or 33%)
Skills for Employment and Work Experience were associated with an increase in the incidence of employment by approximately 10 percentage points each (25% and 29%, respectively)
Finally, Enhanced Employment Assistance Services had the smallest effect, increasing the incidence of employment by 3.05 percentage points (or 8%)

Net impact: Social assistance
Participation in Skills for Employment and Wage Subsidy were the most effective at reducing participants’ use of social assistance.
The overall  net impact on social assistance was $-40.64 (or a 0.8% decrease since the start of the intervention) over 5 years
Skills for Employment was the most effective for decreasing the use of social assistance by $395 (or 8%), on average, over 5 years
An average reduction of social assistance of $395 may be a small amount at an individual level. However, this may result in a substantial saving for the government when aggregated across populations over time
Wage Subsidy interventions also showed a significant decrease in social assistance by an average of $339 (or 8%) over 5 years
While Enhanced Employment Assistance Services showed an increase in social assistance, this result was not statistically significant

Program reforms
Reforms introduced in Budgets 2012, 2013, and 2014 resulted in the following operational changes:
Employment experience is now included in all projects except Employer Awareness projects and can include either wage subsidies or self-employment activities
Wage subsidies can only be acquired for jobs that are:
part of an employer’s normal operations and
likely to lead to a permanent job
Short duration (6 months) training programs can only be supported if they help participants develop skills:
“related to a specific employment opportunity
in a stable or expanding sector, and
where there is a reasonable expectation of employment”
Allowing employers to hire students with disabilities on a part time basis
All projects except stand alone Employer Awareness must have a minimum of 8 participants
For multi-year projects, the number of clients employed, self-employed, or returned to school is measured after 6 and 12 months post-intervention, rather than after 24 weeks
Applicants who include an alternative social innovation model as a framework for project activities do not have to leverage funding from non-Departmental sources
Effects of program reforms
Post-program reforms show positive results.
The 2014 to 2015 reforms show evidence of increased earnings and reduced dependence on income support one year after the program.
Average earnings were 124% higher for program participants in the post-reform period then in the pre-reform period
Similarly, dependence on income support dropped 5-fold in the post-reform period than in the pre-reform period (-7.79 percentage points in the post-reform period versus -1.21 in the pre-reform period)
Note that the comparison is only 1-year post reform

Cost-benefit analysis
The Opportunities Fund program yielded a positive return on investment over the 10 year post-program period for individuals and society as a whole.
The incremental impact analysis, presented earlier, assesses the success of interventions focusing on the first 5 years following an intervention (up to 2017). As a result, this type of analysis does not inform the longer term impacts that such interventions may have on participants. Nor does it indicate whether the benefits associated with the interventions outweigh its costs.
To assess the longer-term impacts associated with the Opportunities Fund, a cost-benefit analysis was conducted. To that end, observed incremental impacts 5 years following an Opportunities Fund intervention were projected for an additional 5 years. For detailed methodology, see the cost-benefit analysis technical report. This analysis reports on the net present value and the benefit-cost ratio from the government, the individual and the society’s perspectives.
From the government’s perspective, costs are incurred up-front and consist of program costs. On the other hand, benefits accrue over time in the form of increased tax revenues and decreased outlays from support programs (for example, social assistance)
From the individual’s perspective, benefits accrue over time and take the form of higher earnings which may contribute to improved social outcomes
From the society’s perspective, the total net benefits of both the government’s and the individual’s perspectives are taken into account (government + individual)
On this basis, the number of years necessary for the accrued benefits to equal the up-front costs (hereafter referred to as ‘break-even’) can be estimated as well as the rate of return.
Cost-benefit Analysis: Other Intangible Benefits
The cost-benefit analysis is based on main quantifiable costs and benefits. Therefore, it does not include intangible benefits such as higher well-being for individuals associated with better health outcomes and reduced criminality. For instance, in addition to producing improvements in labour market indicators, it is likely that active labour market programming such as the Opportunities Fund have positive influences on additional social outcomes such as health and crime. According to research-based evidence, labour market participation and higher income is associated with better health outcomes (see Canadian Institute for Health Information, 2015; Saunders et al., 2017) and lower risk of criminal activity (see Nilsson & Agell, 2003; Machin and Meghir, 2000)
Expanding the cost-benefit framework to include potential savings resulting from improved health outcomes (for example, reduced health system expenditures) and decreases in criminal justice system contact (such as, reduced costs of policing, courts, and correctional services) could yield additional positive impacts for both individuals and the government beyond what is directly measured. Therefore, the estimated cost benefit indicators, such as the social rate of return (the ratio between the net benefit accrued to the society and the direct cost of the program), are conservative estimates for the success of the Opportunities Fund program
The Opportunities Fund program yielded a positive return on investment over the 10 year post program period for individuals and society as a whole.
The social benefit (government + participant) from the Opportunities Fund program is $6,915, yielding an average social rate of return of 170%. This represents 9.4% per annum
Footnote
11
over 10 years post participation.
For participants, the total net benefit is $7,803; and, on the other hand, the total net benefit for governments is -$888.
Overall, from a societal perspective, the discounted benefits of the Opportunities Fund program exceeds the direct program cost in 3.8 years after participation period.

Key findings: Needs
Nearly all employers surveyed indicated the program met their needs.
The majority of employers surveyed 97% (31) indicated that the program met their needs either ‘effectively’ or ‘very effectively’
Figure 17 presents the reasons for participating in the program
Willingness to recommend the program to other employers was measured as a subjective rating on a 1 to 10 scale, with 10 being the most likely to recommend. Reponses were grouped into four categories based on their scores: Promoters (9-10); Passives (7-8); Detractors (1-6)
Most (69%) employers were ‘promoters’ of the program, meaning they were highly likely to recommend the program to a colleague or business associate
25% of employers were only moderately enthusiastic about recommending the program
6% were classified as ‘detractors,’ meaning that they were not enthusiastic about recommending the program

Conclusions
Overall, the Opportunities Fund had a positive and lasting impact on the labour market attachment of participants. Positive impacts were relatively larger for men
Over the 5-year post-participation period, the average annual earnings of participants increased by 38% due to participation in the program. This translates to about $1,100 higher earnings than non-participants with similar characteristics
Skills for Employment and Wage Subsidy were the most effective interventions at improving participants’ employment opportunities and decreasing reliance on social assistance benefits
Social assistance remained an important source of income for Opportunities Fund participants, both before and after participation in an Opportunities Fund intervention
Preliminary findings suggest that, overall, the 2014 to 2015 reform appears promising and has strengthened the impact of the Opportunities Fund on labour market attachments one year after participation
When taking into account costs and benefits for both governments and participants, the Opportunities Fund yielded a positive social return on investment over the 10 years, post-participation
From a societal perspective, benefits outweigh their associated costs in less than four years. Overall, $1 investment in Opportunities Fund program yields $1.7 in return over a 10-year period following the intervention
Moreover, $1 of investment in Skills For Employment yields $4.40 in return over 10 years following the intervention (5 years observed plus 5 years projected)
Employers see the program as useful for both:
increasing their awareness of persons with disabilities as employees, and
meeting their own business needs
Recommendations
The program should examine the means by which the department can directly access employers participating in Opportunities Fund programming for the purpose of evaluation and performance measurement
Explore different ways to collect more granular data on the Skills for Employment intervention. This would allow for an increased understanding of what elements contribute to changes in employment and employment earnings
Re-examine the 6-month limit placed on training programs as a result of the 2014 to 2015 program reforms. Given that the participants in the Skills for Employment intervention experienced a lower average income after the reforms than before, the preliminary evidence suggests that this decision may not have had its intended effect
Management response / Action plan
Overall Management Response
Employment and Social Development Canada's Skills and Employment Branch and Program Operations Branch thank the Evaluation Division for conducting Phase 2 of the evaluation of the Opportunities Fund for Persons with Disabilities. Also acknowledged are the contributions of the service providers that collected the administrative data on which this evaluation is based.
Projects funded by the Opportunities Fund give participants the opportunity to acquire or develop employment readiness skills and/or to obtain employment experience or assistance in becoming self-employed. The program gives supports to:
increase employer awareness of the contributions that persons with disabilities bring to the workplace
assist employers to develop and improve policies and practices to recruit, employ and retain persons with disabilities
help with workplace accommodations
The Program had a positive and lasting impact on the labour market attachment and employment outcome of participants. The evaluation also points to improvements that will allow the program to continue building on the positive employment outcomes for persons with disabilities.
Employment and Social Development Canada is already addressing some of the findings identified in this Phase 2 report. For example, reporting tools have been developed and implemented to collect performance data on employer-focused activities and measure the impacts of these interventions. The program is analyzing data collected using these tools so that they can be further refined.
Additionally, plans for engagement are underway to seek input from a range of key stakeholders on the design and delivery of the program. Plans include increasing women’s participation in Opportunities Fund projects and improving their employment outcomes. Future programming efforts will also seek to strengthen services to women with disabilities.
Recommendation #1
The program should examine the means by which the department can directly access employers participating in Opportunities Fund programming for the purpose of evaluation and performance measurement.
Management response
Employment and Social Development Canada agrees with this recommendation. As part of the Skills and Employment Branch’s commitment to demonstrate results and support performance measurement and evaluation, options will be explored to give direct access to employers participating in the program’s third party-delivered projects, taking into account privacy requirements. This will be done in collaboration with the Program Operations Branch and with input from service providers to ensure effective implementation. Additionally, as the program evolves the Performance Information Profile (PIP) will be updated to ensure the appropriate indicators are in place to track employer-focused activities.
Action item 1.1: Engage employers to consult on employer-focused interventions.
To be completed in June 2021.
Action item 1.2: Revise the program’s Logic Model and PIP to reflect the new policy directions of the employer-focused activities under the new National Workplace Accessibility program of the Opportunities Fund. To be completed in October 2021.
Recommendation #2
Explore different ways to collect more granular data on the Skills for Employment intervention. This would allow for an increased understanding of what elements contribute to changes in employment and employment earnings.
Management response
Employment and Social Development Canada agrees with this recommendation. The Skills and Employment Branch will explore ways to refine existing tools to allow the collection of more detailed information on Skills for Employment interventions. This work will be undertaken in the context of updating the program’s PIP and refining tracking and reporting tools. The tool(s) to be developed in collaboration with POB will be shared with service providers for feedback to ensure feasibility and effective implementation and minimize the reporting burden.
Action item 2.1: Review and update the reporting tools to be implemented for new projects in the next CFP.
To be completed in October 2021.
Recommendation #3
Re-examine the 6-month limit placed on training programs as a result of the 2014 to 2015 program reforms. Given that the participants in the Skills for Employment intervention experienced a lower average income after the reforms than before, the preliminary evidence suggests that this decision may not have had its intended effect.
Management response
Employment and Social Development Canada agrees with this recommendation. SEB will reassess the time limit on training to give service providers more flexibility to deliver tailored interventions that best meet the needs of persons with disabilities (different disability types and varying degrees of severity) to achieve better employment outcomes for persons with disabilities. A consultation process will be used to engage third-party service providers, which is part of planned stakeholder engagement activities, to inform the design and delivery of the program including preparation for the next Call for Proposals.
Action item 3.1: Work in collaboration with POB to solicit feedback from service providers.
To be completed in October 2021.
Action item 3.2: Change the time limit and provide new directives accordingly. 
        To be completed in October 2021.
Annex A: Methodology
Phase 2 of the evaluation is based on 2 lines of evidence:
Survey of employers
A convenience sample drawn from a list of organizations that received Opportunities Fund funding
Total sample was 88 NGOs and 32 employers
Web-based questionnaire
Net impact analysis
Labour Market Program Data Platform
Opportunities Fund administrative data were integrated with:
CRA income tax data
Footnote
19
EI Part 1 data
EI Part 2 data
N=8866 Opportunities Fund clients
Difference-in-Difference statistical analysis
Propensity score matching
Use of a control group
Administrative data and incremental impact methodology
The administrative data used to measure the effect of the program for participants on key outcomes consisted of linking together the three following data sources:
the client administrative data, consisting of socio-demographic and labour market intervention type and duration related variables
Employment Insurance Part 1 and Part 2 data
Canada Revenue Agency T1 and T4 data
The evaluation removed personal identifiers to protect privacy and confidentiality.
The data were thoroughly assessed and transformed into high-quality analytical files. that included a large number of variables relevant to individuals’ labour market experiences. These variables included:
socio-demographic characteristics of both participant and comparison cases
age
gender
marital status
disability
province of residence
background qualifications
occupational group
industry codes
labour market history
use of EI benefits
employment/self-employment earnings
use of social assistance
incidence of employment in the 5-year pre-participation period
To assess incremental impact, the evaluation compared the outcomes of a treatment group of Opportunities Fund participants with a comparison group using other services. The treatment group participated in an intervention during the reference period of January 2011 and December 2012. The comparison group included:
individuals who shared the same eligibility criteria as OF participants
who received only minor interventions via Employment Assistance Services (EAS) as part of the Labour Market Development Agreements (LMDA)
The evaluation used the same reference period for both groups.
Some participants had multiple interventions during the observation period.  These were categorised based on the most intensive intervention, and therefore the most salient one with respect to incremental impacts. This strategy for developing the comparison group was applied in many previous ESDC evaluations. Evaluators measured performance using 5 outcome indicators:
probability of employment
aggregate employment earnings
amount of employment insurance benefits received
amount of Social Assistance benefits received, and
reliance on income support
The proposed methodology is built on the same framework as the evaluation of the Labour Market Development Agreements (LMDA). The procedure for estimating net impacts is based on a non-experimental approach that measures the success of the program by comparing the actual outcomes for the participants in the interventions to their counterfactual outcomes (such as, the outcomes they would have experienced in the absence of the intervention). Because one cannot measure a given individual’s outcomes under both participation and non-participation in an Opportunity Fund intervention, one needs an appropriate comparison group to “stand in” as the counterfactual.
For all counterfactual comparisons, the net impact results were produced using a state-of-the-art combination of difference-in-differences estimation and propensity score kernel matching methods (Heckman et al., 1997). Given the breadth of background variables available in the linked data files, one can be reasonably confident that the impact estimates are robust (Lechner & Wunsch, 2013).
The main advantage of this evaluation methodology is that the universe of the comparison group is very large. This makes it possible to obtain close matches to program participants in terms of their observable characteristics. After consulting external academic experts (peer reviewers), evaluators selected a subset of EAS clients. This group was the best choice because of data availability and the fact that ESDC has considerable experience in using it as a comparison group.
A potential limitation of the analysis is that it is not feasible to measure the effectiveness of the Opportunities Fund for clients with different types and severity of disability. The impacts of Opportunities Fund for an individual with a single or mild disability will be different from the impacts for individuals with many or severe disabilities.  Unfortunately, there is virtually no information in the administrative database to identify these individuals.  However, the previous Opportunities Fund summative evaluation indicated that approximately equal proportions of survey participants reported a mild, moderate, or severe disability.
Lastly, one limitation of propensity score matching is that it is impossible to completely rule out the influence of unobserved factors on the results. This limitation applies to all non-experimental approaches to estimating treatment effects and techniques. However, given:
the strength of the administrative data
the wealth of covariates used in the analysis, and
the ability of DID to control to some extent for unmeasured factors
We can be reasonably sure that the magnitude and direction of the estimates will not be greatly affected by the presence of unobserved confounders.
Cost-benefit analysis
The reference period for the cost-benefit analysis consists of participants who started their intervention between January 2011 and December 2012. This analysis looked at the labour market outcomes during the year of participation in the intervention. It continued to observe the labour market outcomes for 5 years after the participants had completed their intervention. Observed outcomes over the 5-year post-participation period are then projected for an additional 5 years, for a total period of 10 years post participation.
The cost-benefit analysis reports on the net present value and the benefit-cost ratio from the perspectives of:
the individual
the government, and
society (individual + government)
An accounting framework determined who bore a particular cost or benefit. All benefits were discounted (by a rate of 3%) after the participation start year.
Limitations: The cost-benefit analysis is based on major quantifiable costs and benefits available in the:
administrative database, and
Employment Insurance Monitoring and Assessment Report
It does not include intangible benefits such as higher well-being for individuals related to better health outcomes and reduced criminality.
In addition to producing improvements in labour market indicators, it is likely that active labour market programming such as the Opportunities Fund also has positive influences on additional social outcomes such as health and crime. According to research evidence, labour market participation and higher income is associated with better health outcomes (for example, Canadian Institute for Health Information, 2015; Saunders and al. 2017) and lower risk of criminal activity (for example, Nilsson & Agell, 2003; Machin & Meghir, 2000). Expanding the cost-benefit framework to include potential savings resulting from improved health outcomes (in other words, reduced health system expenditures) and decreases in criminal justice system contact in other words, reductions in the costs of policing, courts, and correctional services) could yield additional positive impacts for both individuals and the government beyond what is directly measured.
Annex B: Study limitations
The agreement between ESDC and Opportunities Fund participants did not allow the Evaluation Directorate to contact employers directly to ask them to participate in the survey. So, we had to rely on third-party organizations to contact employers. This excluded the possibility of a truly random sample where each element has an equal and known chance of being selected into the sample.
The survey of employers coincided with the onset of covid-19 in March, 2020, making it difficult for employers to participate in the survey.
Assessment of the effects of the 2014 to 2015 program reforms were limited by the absence of data post 2016. In addition, there is no statistical control for differences between cohorts which could change the size of the observed differences.
It is not feasible to measure the success of Opportunities Fund for clients with different types and levels of disability severity. The impacts of the Opportunities Fund for an individual with a single or mild disability will be different from the impacts for individuals with many or severe disabilities.
The cost benefit analysis is based on major quantifiable costs and benefits available in the administrative database and Employment Insurance Monitoring and Assessment Report. It does not include intangible benefits such as improvement of participants’ mental and physical well-being associated with increased incomes and reduced duration of unemployment. Other benefits could include reducing crime, increasing the labour supply, and reducing pressure on wages. In addition, shortening the duration of job loss and improving incomes may have spin-off benefits that improve the psychological and social impacts on partners and families.

Annex E: Phase I questions and findings
Has progress been made towards achieving expected outcomes?  Is the program delivered in a cost-effective manner?
Phase 1 showed that the program meets the needs of its clients. Even if awareness of support provided to workers with disabilities was not well known among employers. In terms of costs, the cost-per-beneficiary was comparable, if not lower, than similar labour force support programs. These included the Aboriginal Skills and Employment Training Strategy and the Youth Employment Strategy.
To what extent has the reformed OF program, including Ready, Willing and Able and CommunityWorks, been implemented as designed?
Evidence indicated that most participants gain work experience in small and medium sized enterprises. However, there appeared to be a deficit in demand-driven training. In addition, work placements were seen as too short in length. Both Ready, Willing and Able and CommunityWorks faced implementation challenges.
To what extent does OF address demonstrable needs of program participants, as well as needs of employers?  To what extent do these specific needs persist?
There is evidence that the Opportunities Fund could be better known among service providers and potential clients, including employers. The Phase I report also revealed that meeting the needs of participants can sometimes require additional resources that have to be obtained through other programs or organizations.
What are pre-program, in-program and post-program labour market outcomes for PWDs who participate in the OF Program, by intervention type and overall? (Incidence of Employment, Earnings, SA use, SA benefits, EI use, EI benefits).
The percentage of participants who were employed, self-employed or returned to school, up to 12 months after their last program intervention, increased progressively from 42% in 2012 to 2013 to 55% in 2016 to 2017. On average, during this period, the Program served 4,316 persons with disabilities every year; of these, 41% (1,791) were employed or self-employed, and 6% (253) had returned to school after the end of an intervention. On average, 53% (2,272) of participants were neither employed, self-employed nor returned to school after the Program.
To what extent do Opportunities Fund objectives reflect ESDC strategic outcomes and broad federal government policy directions and priorities? To what extent does Opportunities Fund continue to align with federal and departmental roles and responsibilities?
The Opportunities Fund continues to align with the priorities, roles and responsibilities of Employment and Social Development Canada and the federal government. This is reflected in the government’s engagement towards the elimination of barriers to employment for persons with disabilities and the recent tabling of new federal accessibility legislation.
What is the reach of the Opportunities Fund?
The Opportunities Fund served approximately 4,300 clients per year, on average, from fiscal year 2012 to 2013 to fiscal year 2016 to 2017. As of 2012 (most recent estimates available), approximately 103,300 Canadians aged 15 to 64 had a disability and had never worked or had not worked in the previous 5 years despite having the potential to work.
Has progress been made towards achieving expected key outcomes of the Opportunities Fund program?
Evidence indicates that progress is being made towards achieving the program’s direct outcomes. From 2012 and 2013 to 2016 and 2017, the percentage of participants who were employed, self-employed or returned to school (up to 12 months after their last intervention) increased progressively from 42% to 55%.
What is the quality of Opportunities Fund project administrative data?
Administrative data were found to be of good quality, while gaps were identified in relation to up-to-date participant contact information and information on employers in general.
Annex F: Outcome indicators
Average Annual Employment Income: This indicator is derived from CRA data (T4 supplementary and T1 tax return records). It shows the yearly average of all types of employment income for the 2011 to 2012 OF participants, consisting of income from:
paid employment
self-employment
net farming
net fishing
net commission
net professional
aboriginal earnings, and
other employment income
The income is measured in constant dollars, with 2011 as the base year.
Proportion of Participants Employed
To examine the proportion of participants who were employed during the pre- and post-program periods, we created a binary variable of “employment status.” The variable takes on the value “1” if the individual had employment earnings within a given calendar year (in either the pre- or post-participation period); and “0” if not. Using this variable, we can estimate the yearly fraction of employed participants.
Average Annual Employment Insurance (EI) Benefit:
This indicator measures the average yearly EI benefits received by participants during the pre- and post-program periods and is extracted from EI Part I data. The total EI benefit is measured in constant dollars, with 2011 as the base year.
Average Annual Social Assistance (SA) Benefit:
This indicator measures the average yearly amount of SA benefits received by participants during the pre- and post-program periods. The total yearly SA benefit received by participants was used to derive this indicator, taken from T1 tax return records. The total SA benefit is measured in constant dollars, with 2011 as the base year.
Dependence on Income Support:
This is defined as the following ratio:
Dependence on Income Support =
(EI Benefits + Social Assistance)
(EI Benefits + Social Assistance + Total Earnings)
where “Total Earnings” includes wages and salaries as well as income from self-employment.

Footnote 2
There was no information on Service and Development interventions in 2017-2018. Consequently, they were not included. In 2011-2012, there were 0.8% of the Opportunities Fund clients participating in Service interventions and 0.5% of the Opportunities Fund clients participating in Development interventions.
