Key findings
The Canada Education Savings Program serves its function by providing incentives for parents, family and friends of children to save for their post-secondary education, including those from low- and middle-income families. Since 2010, Canada Education Savings Grant payments increased by 52% (from $679.8 million in 2010 to $1.0 billion in 2020). Canada Learning Bond (CLB) payments increased by 134% (from $65.2 million in 2010 to $152.4 million in 2020).
At the end of 2020, the total number of children who had ever received the CLB represented 41.9% of the eligible population. This indicates a need for greater awareness and easier access to the bond.
The CLB take-up remains higher in urban areas compared to rural areas. Urban take-up increased from 22% in 2010 to 45% in 2020, while rural take-up increased from 13% in 2010 to 29% in 2020.
Barriers prevent potential beneficiaries from receiving the CLB, such as:
awareness
understanding
the complexity of the Registered Education Savings Plan opening process
Recommendation
Explore options to simplify the process to access the CLB, and consider targeted strategies to increase CLB take-up among marginalized groups and populations in remote areas.
