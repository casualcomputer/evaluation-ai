Highlights
This evaluation examined the performance of the Occupational  Health and Safety Program, within the Labour Program of Employment and Social  Development Canada (ESDC). It complies with the 2016 Treasury Board policy on results, and covers the period  from fiscal year 2011 to 2012 and up to fiscal year 2015 to 2016. A fiscal year runs from  April 1 to March 31.
Definitions for terms marked with an asterisk (*)  can be found in Annex A.
Key findings and recommendations
This evaluation found that program activities have  contributed to a safe and healthy workplace. For instance, the majority of  surveyed federally regulated employers (91%) and employees (71%) found that  Occupational Health and Safety regulations adequately ensured a safe and  healthy workplace. Key highlights of this evaluation are as follows:
Modernization and awareness
There are emerging challenges in occupational health and  safety, particularly in the areas of mental health and non-standard*  employment, leading to a rise in vulnerable* workers.
Recommendation 1: Increase awareness of occupational health  and safety to address emerging challenges, prevent future issues and risks, and  further support vulnerable workers.
Proactive activities
As the Disabling injury incidence rate* increased by 7% over  the evaluation period, proactive inspections dropped by 45% and the number of  inspection officers declined.
Recommendation 2: Explore ways to increase proactive  activities, including strategically targeted inspections in high risk sectors,  in order to detect violations and prevent potential injuries and/or illnesses.
Reactive activities
While all surveyed employers are satisfied with the results  stemming from the internal complaints resolution process, employees are  considerably less satisfied (60%) with the overall process, including the  timeliness of services (55%).
Recommendation 3: Identify and address issues that may have  hindered the effectiveness of the internal complaints resolution process, and  develop service standards to address violations in a timely and effective  manner.
Performance measurement practices
The performance measurement practices in place do not fully  support the monitoring and measuring of expected outcomes, such as compliance  with the Code and incidence rates in high-risk sectors.
Recommendation 4: To support monitoring and reporting  activities, the program could improve performance measurement practices to  capture reliable information with respect to key metrics, such as incidence rates,  compliance levels, and the severity of violations.
Management response
Modernization and awareness
Recommendation 1
Increase  awareness of occupational health and safety to address emerging challenges,  prevent future issues and risks, and further support vulnerable workers.
Response:
The Labour  Program agrees with the recommendation to modernize and increase awareness of  occupational health and safety regulations.
In response to the recommendation of the 2016 Audit of the  OHS Program to develop a strategic  framework for data gathering and analysis to improve program monitoring and  reporting, management created the Business Intelligence Unit and  associated Business Intelligence Strategic Framework to improve data  accessibility and data integrity.
Management  will continue to engage with stakeholders, including employee and employer  representatives, and federal, provincial and territorial jurisdictions by using  established platforms such as the Occupational Health and Safety  Advisory Committee (OHSAC) and the Canadian Association of Administrators of  Labour Legislation - Occupational Health and Safety (CAALL-OHS).
Action  1:
The Labour Program will use various platforms (internal and  external) to consult, monitor, gather information and increase awareness within  the Labour Program of emerging occupational health and safety issues in the  workplace (ongoing).
Action  2:
Establish a Strategic Stakeholder Relations Unit within the  OHS Program to monitor key emerging issues (ongoing).
Action  3:
The Labour Program will create a framework to consolidate  the activities in which the OHS Program participates (March 2019):
having technical experts attend international  conferences in order to remain up to date with international issues and  practices
participating in an artificial intelligence  pilot project, and
OHS regulatory harmonization
Action  4:
The Labour Program will develop a proposal to establish a  prevention approach to occupational health and safety issues (November 2019).
This proposal will determine the best approach to  anticipating the occupational health and safety risks that exist specifically  for vulnerable workers.
Proactive activities
Recommendation 2
Explore  ways to increase proactive activities, including strategically targeted  inspections in high risk sectors, in order to detect violations and prevent  potential injuries and/or illnesses.
Response:
The Labour  Program agrees with the recommendation to increase proactive activities,  including strategically targeted inspections in high-risk sectors.
Action  1:
The Program  is conducting research on prevention to determine ways to improve its proactive  activities, particularly in high-risk sectors such as transport (March 2020).
Action  2:
The Program  is conducting a pilot project using data from workers compensation boards in  Saskatchewan to gather information on where proactive activities should be  targeted (Start date: January 2019).
Action  3:
A pilot  project is underway in the Quebec and the Central regions to test the  re-allocation of inspections using a new targeting tool to address prevention  (March 2020).
Reactive activities
Recommendation 3
Identify  and address issues that may have hindered the effectiveness of the internal  complaint resolution process, and develop service standards to address  violations in a timely and effective manner.
Response:
The Labour Program agrees with the recommendation to  identify and address issues with the Internal Complaint Resolution Process and  develop service standards.
In response to the 2016 Audit of the OHS Program recommendation  to develop a comprehensive service  delivery strategy to formalize regular activities and interactions with clients  and stakeholders, management developed Client Service Delivery Standards  and a Client/Stakeholder Engagement Strategy.
Action  1:
The Labour program will produce a report examining the  reasons as to why there is sometimes failure to achieve consensus within the  workplace on refusal to work cases by consulting with stakeholders (May 2019).
Action  2:
The Program will conduct an analysis on ways in which health  and safety officers (HSO) can better help workplace parties throughout the  course of the internal complaint resolution process (September 2019). The  Program will then develop more tools and guidance documents for use by HSOs.
Action  3:
The Labour Program developed and published service standards
Footnote
1
associated with specific  processes in November 2018, in order to reduce employee dissatisfaction with  the length of time in which their complaint was resolved.
The outcome and efficiency resulting from the implementation  of the service standards is expected to be determined further to the strategic  operational planning and yearly cycle reviews. Conducting systematic follow-ups  and reviews of service standards and their outcomes will help identify areas in  which improvements or other service standards can be implemented, in order to  better respond to issues or concerns of clients and further reduce employee  dissatisfaction (ongoing).
Performance measurement practices
Recommendation 4
To support  monitoring and reporting activities, the program could improve performance  measurement practices to capture reliable information with respect to key  metrics, such as incidence rates, compliance levels, and the severity of violations.
Response:
The Labour  Program agrees with the recommendation to improve performance measurement  practices.
In response to the 2016 Audit of the OHS Program  recommendation to develop a  program-wide quality control process, including indicators to measure the  on-going effectiveness of key OHS processes, management developed a quality  control framework that is supported by an overarching OHS performance  measurement framework.
Over the  past 2 years, the Program has worked to examine processes and expected  outcomes and, as part of TBS’ annual Performance Information Profile, develop a  number of performance indicators by which to measure the effectiveness of its  activities, as well as areas where improvements could be made.
Action  1:
The Program will continue to update the annual Performance  Information Profile and track changes in incidence and compliance rates  (ongoing).
Action  2:
The Program will continue to assess its expected outcomes  and indicators on an annual basis, and implement adjustments based on  legislative and regulatory changes (such as is currently being conducted for  harassment and violence prevention) (ongoing).
Program and evaluation overview
Program
The Occupational Health and Safety Program (“the Program”)  is administered by the Labour Program in Employment and Social Development  Canada and is composed of the Workplace Directorate,
Footnote
2
and the Regional  Operations and Compliance Directorate.
Footnote
3
The Program enforces the occupational health and safety  provisions under Part II of the
Canada Labour Code
for federally  regulated* workplaces.
The Program strives to ensure safe and healthy workplaces  for all federal jurisdiction employees by preventing or reducing the incidence  of work-related injuries and fatalities in federal jurisdiction workplaces.  This is done through awareness of health and safety issues and assisting  employers and employees understand their duties and rights.
Footnote
4
The Program’s logic model in Annex B outlines its  activities, outputs, and expected outcomes.
The average annual program spending between fiscal year 2011 to 2012  and fiscal year 2015 to 2016 was $16.8 million.
Footnote
5
See Annex C for more  information about the program and a breakdown of program spending.
Evaluation
The evaluation assessed the Program’s performance by  examining its:
emerging issues and challenges
proactive and reactive activities
implementation of changes to Part II of the
Canada  Labour Code
, and
data collection and performance measurement  strategies or practices
These issues were guided by 8 evaluation questions  (Annex D) and relied upon 5 lines of evidence (Annex E).
Context
The changing nature of work may be making the  standard definitions of employment outdated, including some employee  occupational health and safety protections in federally regulated workplaces
Non-standard employment and health issues continue to  emerge:
unionization rates are declining and non-standard work arrangements are increasing (for example, term, contract* and  casual employment).
these  developments have led to a rise in vulnerable* workers which can be associated  with reduced control over working conditions and/or protections of rights.
employees’  mental health and well-being in the workplace has also been a growing issue.
Technology is changing the workplace:
technological  advancements are broadening the scope of the physical workplace allowing more  variations, such as telework.
the  increasing use of technology is altering the nature of work and leading to  health and safety concerns.
Key findings
Modernize regulations and support vulnerable  employees
The Program is working towards updating and  modernizing regulations to reflect the changing nature of the workplace
Most advanced economies lack the capacity in their  management of Occupational Health and Safety or its regulatory system to  address emerging issues arising from precarious, casual, and temporary  employment* (
Gallagher, 2012
).
Between  1997 and 2017, the proportion of temporary workers increased by 2.2 percentage  points to reach 11.6%, or 2.1 million of the total workforce* in Canada.
Footnote
6
Contract  employment experienced the biggest rise as a form of temporary employment,  growing by almost 97% in the same period.
Footnote
7
Mental health in the workplace was also identified as an  issue that has emerged.
Employer and employee interviewees reported  becoming increasingly aware of mental health issues in the workplace, including  its intersection with drugs, alcohol, and violence.
Employers reported concerns regarding mental  health issues in the workplace, including the scope of their responsibility,  the challenges in investigating and capturing information, and the need for  expertise and specialized services.
Employer interviewees noted that the rise in technology is  increasing the risk of potential health issues.
Program officials noted that violations related  to handling hazardous materials were frequent, and employers noted the need for  improvements to address technical  issues.
The program has a number of tools to address emerging  issues, such as providing website information on stress, violence and bullying;  consulting with the tripartite Occupational Health and Safety Advisory Council;  maintaining contact with field staff regarding emerging issues on the ground;  and leveraging research conducted by the Canadian Centre for Occupational  Health and Safety.
Gender-based analysis plus
The Program collects limited gender-based plus  information on vulnerable employees in both temporary and permanent employment  situations
Disaggregated employee-related information, by type of  employment, and other key areas such as gender and representation (for example,  disability, minorities), is not collected by the Program.
Footnote
8
This information could  support the monitoring and reporting of information that could support  strategic decision-making.
Gender-based information in the 2015 Federal Jurisdiction  Workplace Survey indicates that 19% of women and 11% of men in federally  regulated workplaces are part-time employees.
Footnote
9
A survey  conducted by Statistics Canada in 2017 found that women represented almost 52%  of temporary workers in Canada. This proportion has been fairly consistent  since 1997.
Between  1997 and 2017, the growth of women representation in temporary employment* was  almost 75%, as compared to men at almost 59%.
Interviewees noted a need for greater Program support  regarding emerging issues related to the more vulnerable* groups, such as  protection for employees hired by human resource agencies, and employer safety  compliance within non-traditional  work arrangements, such as telework.
Legislation
The program has implemented several legislative  changes, however, there is an indication that further training is needed to  ensure a clear understanding of certain notions in the Code
During the evaluation period, the  majority of the refusal of dangerous work cases were found to present no  danger.
Employers noted that it may be  unclear to employees what constitutes a danger-related complaint.
Footnote
10
Employees indicated that Labour  Program inspection officers’ training was insufficient, which resulted in them  not always being able to identify complex dangers or hazards.
Footnote
11
In 2014, the definition of ‘danger’* was amended to:
clarify its intended use for employers and  employees
channel non-dangerous cases through their applicable  mechanisms, and
encourage the use of the internal responsibility  system* and the Hazard Prevention Program*
In fiscal year 2015 to 2016, the  number of refusal of dangerous work cases reaching the Program decreased by  73%.
Footnote
12
The Program does not collect data  that could identify the cause for this drop nor track the cases managed through  the internal responsibility system.

Compliance
A majority of  employers comply with Part II of the
Canada Labour Code
, and there has  been compliance improvements since 2012
A sector’s violation rate may be affected by  the extent it is targeted for proactive inspections. This may result in higher  violation rates in high risk sectors.
The number of employers in a sector, and the  violation rate per employer, are 2 different indicators in understanding the  degree of code violations.
Footnote
13
Employers in the trucking sector had a below average violation rate of 3.6%, however this sector had the highest total employer population at 60%.
Employers in the public service sector composed less than 2% of the total employer       population, these employers had an annual violation rate of 16.2%.

An average of 4.4% of employers had at least  one violation against Part II of the
Canada Labour Code
, in each calendar  year of the evaluation.
While an average of 1.4% of employers  received a complaint filed with the Program in a year.
Awareness of regulations
Most employers and employees were aware of their  rights and responsibilities
The evaluation  surveys of federally regulated* employers and employees indicated that:
91% of employers and 71% of employees found that  occupational health and safety regulations adequately ensured a safe workplace
92% of employers and 75% of employees stated  that employers comply with the requirement to provide employees with  information on their occupational health and safety rights and  responsibilities, and
91% of employers and 79% of employees said that  employees fulfill their responsibility to report hazards and contraventions
Employer and  employee survey responses indicated that each party had a strong awareness of each party’s rights and  responsibilities under Part II of the
Canada  Labour Code
.
Footnote
14
However, employees  were consistently less favorable than employers regarding each party’s degree  of compliance with their rights  and responsibilities.
Footnote
15
Disabling injury incidence rate
The federal jurisdiction has achieved success in  reducing its disabling injury incidence rate, but it still lags behind some  provincial levels
During the evaluation period,  the Disabling injury incidence rate* was a key program indicator that measured  safety levels in federally regulated* workplaces.
Footnote
16
Between 2011 and 2015, the 2% annual reduction target for this Rate was only  achieved in 2013.
As employment under the federal  jurisdiction continued to rise, the number of federal inspection officers*  declined annually until fiscal year 2015 to 2016, when it rose sharply by 43%.
Footnote
17
The five-year average for this  federal level incidence rate compared favourably with most provincial and  territorial time-loss work injury rates
Footnote
18
over the same period.
The federal level rate lagged  4 provinces, with Ontario being in the lead at 46% lower than the federal  rate.
Footnote
19
Other available data indicates  that nearly all of the provinces and territories registered declines in their work loss-time  injury rates over 2011 to 2015.
Footnote
20
During the evaluation period, the Disabling injury incidence rate increased from 1.73 to 1.85 disabling injuries per 100 full-time equivalents. This is largely due to changes in reporting practices by one industrial sector representing approximately 5% of employees.

Proactive and reactive activities
Improvements in the use of proactive activities would  encourage greater employer compliance to the Code
The literature  review indicated that proactive activities are viewed as a best  practice.
Footnote
22
The document review showed that  inspections help prevent incidents, injuries and illnesses.
Footnote
23
Proactive activities  are included in the Program’s 2015 Strategic Operational Plan, including  performing scheduled inspections to identify violations.
During the  evaluation period, the administrative data review indicated that:
the  Program dedicated an average of 57% of all assignment hours towards  proactive activities, thereby missing its  annual target of spending 80% of its assignment hours on proactive work;  and
the relative number of inspections amongst the  lowest compliant sectors was inconsistent over the evaluation period, thereby  potentially skewing the calculated number of violations found.
As well, there was generally an inadequate number of Program officers  available to undertake compliance and enforcement activities, particularly  proactive inspections.
Footnote
24
For instance, the number of officers per  employee under the federal jurisdiction dropped by 54% between 2007 and 2011.
Footnote
25
As indicated in  Table 1, the Program did less proactive inspections by the end of the  evaluation period, but found more violations during each inspection.

The literature  review found that each proactive inspection reduced the number of disabling  injuries in the following year by 0.33 on average.
Footnote
27
Based on this, Table 1 shows the potential number of disabling injuries that  was prevented based on the number of proactive inspections completed during the  first and last fiscal years of the evaluation period.
The literature also  proposed a targeting tool that suggests conducting the same number of proactive  inspections, but shifting some inspections to sectors, such as the public  service, where the Program could have a greater impact in reducing the injury  rates.
Footnote
28
The average cost and  time to resolve a violation increased over the evaluation period, resulting in  a 19% average increase in Program expenses to resolve each violation.
Footnote
29
Internal complaint resolution process
The internal complaint resolution process does not  sufficiently support some employees’ needs
Employees can  initiate the internal complaint resolution process* where they perceive a  situation is non-dangerous, or dangerous if it were ever carried out. Unlike a  Refuse to Work situation, the employee continues to work, while collaborating  with their employer to seek a resolution to the matter.
The complaints process has been an effective mechanism for identifying  violations, with a possible 79% of complaints over the evaluation period  resulting in a violation.
Footnote
30
As shown in Table 2,  the evaluation survey found that most employees who had made an Occupational  Health and Safety complaint were unsatisfied with various aspects of the complaint  process.
Footnote
31
For example, while all employers believed their organization had made changes  based on a complaint, 66% of employees said that changes were not made.

Performance measurement and data collection
The Program data collection  systems need improvement to more accurately capture its client universe, and to  support performance measurement
Data collection and reporting
The Program’s database of employers contains information on  those who make themselves known to the Program.
Footnote
32
As a result, some employers do not receive  program services such as inspections, and some employers and employees are not  aware Program consultation processes and educational material developed.
In order to improve data integrity, the Program has  identified the need to improve the employers’ compliance with their legislative  requirement to annually report on hazardous occurrences, as a priority.
Footnote
33
A 2017 Employment and Social Development Canada Innovation  Lab study and evaluation interviews found the report used to collect annual  injury data requires core modifications, such as a simpler format and clearer  instructions, in order to improve the response rate. This was corroborated by  evaluation interviewee feedback.
Labour database
The Integrated Labour System, which is in the process of  replacing the current Labour databases, is expected to centralize all data, as  well as improve data  timeliness and integrity issues.
Footnote
34
Information agreements
The document review indicated that the Program does not have  data sharing agreements with all provincial and territorial  Worker Compensation Boards or commissions, or  other relevant parties.
Footnote
35
Information gaps in  measuring program performance limit the Program’s ability to effectively  support and improve employer compliance
Gaps in measuring program performance
The Program’s ability to conduct certain program activities  (for example, monitoring program  performance, strategically planning for proactive and reactive  activities, and raising awareness to employers and employees) is limited due to  the lack of information on the complete employer universe.
The Disabling Injury Incidence Rate, a Key Performance  Indicator utilized during the evaluation period, is used to inform the  strategic planning of inspections for high risk sectors. The results for each  year of the evaluation are considered representative of the Disabling Injury  Incidence Rate in the federal jurisdiction.
Internal Audit noted the Program’s limited capacity to  measure and report on its performance with the current set of indicators, such  as the Disabling Injury Incidence Rate*. This indicator is not considered to be  a predictive indicator.
Footnote
36
In addition, the following information was not available for  this evaluation or was incomplete.
Data on hazards related to vulnerable* workers,  temporary employment*, and mental health issues was lacking.
Data on Occupational Health and Safety  Direction* orders by sector, issued by the Program to employers regarding  dangerous work situations was not available.
Data on employers in violation of the
Canada  Labour Code
, Part II, after they were found in violation in previous years, was  not available.
Program costing information, such as the average  cost to conduct an inspection, was not available.
Recommendations
The program continues to make significant progress in  establishing and protecting federally regulated employees’ rights to a safe and  healthy work environment. In order to further support the achievement of  program outcomes, the following recommendations are offered:
Recommendation  1:
Increase awareness of occupational health and safety to  address emerging challenges, prevent future issues and risks, and further  support vulnerable workers.
Recommendation  2:
Explore ways to increase proactive activities, including  strategically targeted inspections in high risk sectors, in order to detect  violations and prevent potential injuries and/or illnesses.
Recommendation  3:
Identify and address issues that may have hindered the  effectiveness of the internal complaints resolution process, and develop  service standards to address violations in a timely and effective manner.
Recommendation  4:
To support monitoring and reporting activities, the program  could improve performance measurement practices to capture reliable information  with respect to key metrics, such as incidence rates, compliance levels, and  the severity of violations.
Annexes
Annex A -  Definitions
Assurance of  voluntary compliance:
A written commitment by an employer or employee to  correct a contravention related to a non-dangerous situation within a  specified time. Employers and employees are required to inform the Program of  their corrective action taken to address the Assurance of voluntary compliance.
Contract employment:
Statistics Canada defines this form of temporary employment, which  includes temporary help agency work, as having a termination date.
Danger (pre October  2014):
Any existing or  potential hazard or condition or any current or future activity that  could reasonably be expected to cause  injury or illness to a person exposed to it before the hazard or  condition can be corrected, or the activity altered, whether or not the injury  or illness occurs immediately after the exposure to the hazard, condition or  activity, and includes any exposure to a hazardous substance that is likely to  result in a chronic illness, in disease or in damage to the reproductive  system.
Danger (post October  2014):
Any hazard, condition or activity that could reasonably be  expected to be an imminent or serious  threat to the life or health of a person exposed to it before the hazard  or condition can be corrected or the activity altered [Subsection 122(1)].
Direction:
A  formal written order directing an employer or employee to correct a  contravention within a specified period. Issued during inspections or  investigations, where either the Assurance of voluntary compliance was  unaddressed or the situation is deemed dangerous
.
Disabling injury incidence  rate:
the total number of disabling and fatal occupational injuries per  100 employees, expressed as full-time equivalents (FTEs). It is calculated by  taking the sum of the total number of disabling and fatal injuries on the job  divided by the total number of FTEs and multiplied by 100.
Extended  jurisdiction:
Extended jurisdiction partners to Employment and Social  Development Canada (for example, a Transport Canada official responsible for  air or rail safety) to whom the Minister of Labour has delegated his/ her  powers, duties and functions to administer Part II of the
Canada Labour Code
.
Federal inspection  officers:
Beyond those employed by the Labour Program, this includes  officers from the National Energy Board and Transport Canada.
Federally regulated  employers under Part II of the
Canada Labour Code
:
Applies to  interprovincial and international industries, and includes workplaces in the  private and public sectors, including crown corporations. See Annex G for  details.
Hazardous Prevention  Program:
Part XIX of the
Regulations, entitled Hazard Prevention  Program
, covers obligations concerning the identification of hazards, the  assessment of those hazards, the choice of preventive measures, and employee  education.
Internal complaint  resolution process:
A process established by the Occupational Health and  Safety legislative process that allows for a graduated series of investigations  to resolve work place issues while maintaining employment safety. The process  allows for the resolution of work place health and safety issues in a more  timely and efficient manner and reinforces the concept of the internal  responsibility system.
Internal responsibility system:
An underlying philosophy of occupational health and safety legislation  in Canada. All workplace parties are responsible for health and safety at their  work place; employers, in consultation with workplace parties are required to  implement measures and control procedures that are appropriate for their  individual workplaces. The System is supported by Health and Safety  Representatives in workplaces with less than 19 employees, by Workplace  Committees in workplaces with more than 20 employees, and by Policy Committees  in work places with more than 300 employees.
Non-standard  employment:
Can consist of  part-time or temporary work, or self-employment (
Chaykowski,  R.,
2008).
Prosecution:
Court proceedings based upon non-compliance with provisions of the Canada  Labour Code, Part II. Usually pursued as a result of serious contravention or  when a Direction has not been addressed. Involves escalating fines and/or  imprisonment based on the offence, with a maximum penalty of two years in  prison and $1 million dollars for willfully committing an act likely to cause  serious injury or death.
Total workforce/employment:
All forms of employment, or the combination of non-standard and standard  employment (Statistics Canada).
Temporary employment:
Casual, seasonal, or term/contract. It also includes work via temporary  help agencies (
Statistics  Canada
).
Vulnerable  workers/employees:
Workers with low wages and benefits and in  non-standard work arrangements and hours (
Chaykowski,  R
. 2008).

Annex C - Program background
Program background
Conduct proactive activities that support employer and  employee compliance to Part II of the
Canada Labour Code.
This includes  conducting annual inspections, investigations sourced by employee complaints,  developing information tools, supporting the employer internal responsibility  system*, and issuing Assurances  of Voluntary Compliance*.
Engage in reactive activities to enforce compliance.  Activities include conducting investigations, and pursuing legally binding  actions such as issuing Directions* for dangerous situations and initiating  prosecutions*.
The continuum of proactive to reactive measures applied to  align an employer’s compliance with Part II of the
Canada Labour Code.
Annex C - Text version
The  continuum of proactive to reactive measures applied to align an employer’s  compliance with Part II of the
Canada  Labour Code
consists of four steps.
A  large arrow from left to right indicates that as employers move right through  the four steps of the continuum, the measures evolve from those that apply  voluntary compliance to those that apply legal enforcement.
Step  1 is education and awareness raising of rights and obligations
Step  2 is Assurance of voluntary compliance
Step  3 is Directions (appeals to appeals officers), injunctions, and recourse  against reprisals
Step  4 is Prosecution (imprisonment and/or fines), naming of offenders (corporations  only)

Annex D - Evaluation questions
To  what extent does the program respond to the need to establish health and safety  standards for employees under federal jurisdiction?
To  what extent is the current mix of proactive and reactive assignments effective  in encouraging compliance with the
Canada Labour Code
, Part II?
To  what extent does the use of different mechanisms of enforcement (issuance of  Assurance of voluntary compliance, Directions Investigation of complaints,  filling orders or Prosecution in federal court) help to correct and/or prevent  a breach of the
Canada Labour Code
, Part II?
To  what extent are training and policy and regulatory development in headquarters  aligned with the operational requirements of the program in the regions?
To  what extent are the regulations implemented by the program adequate to  accomplish its stated outcomes?
To  what extent do the programs effectively target the sectors/areas/sections of  legislation where non-compliance is higher?
To  what extent have recent legislative and regulatory changes affected the  program’s performance?
Are  there other types of activities which would be more cost effective?
Annex E - Lines of evidence: descriptions and limitations
The five lines of evidence are the literature review, the document review, administrative data review, key informant interviews, and a survey of employers and employees. Each line of evidence includes a description and its limitations.
Literature review
Description:
An  examination of Occupational Health and Safety issues during the evaluation  period, as well as recent issues and emerging issues (external documents,  studies).
Limitation:
There  was a limited amount of literature related directly to the federal Occupational  Health and Safety program.
Document review
Description:
An  analysis of internal Government of Canada, Employment and Social Development  Canada documents, during the evaluation period, to better understand program  activities.
Limitation:
There may be a gap in the information  available, given that the document review was solely based on readily available  documents. Some internal, unpublished Labour Program documents or studies were  difficult to obtain.
Administrative data review
Description:
An  analysis of administrative data from the Labour Program’s Labour Application  2000 database was conducted.
Limitation:
The  evaluation team (including contractors) did not have direct access to the  Labour Application 2000 database therefore, the data analysis may not be  comprehensive.
Key informant interviews
Description:
Interviews were conducted with 57 key informants, within 6 groups: program  officials, labour law experts, employer and employee representatives, extended  jurisdiction* partners and provincial labour officials.
Limitation:
The  views of key informants are subject to biases. Additionally, the limited sample  of respondents may not be representative of the views of other non-respondents.
Survey of employers and employees
Description:
344  employers and 140 employees responded to the surveys. The surveys assessed  aspects, such as satisfaction with program services, understanding of  procedures, and awareness of proactive activities.
Limitation:
Employers  and employees known to be federally regulated, with available contact  information, were included. The initial target was 650 for both surveys. Only  344 out of 6,100 employers responded to the survey. Only 140 of nearly 3,000  employees responded. Therefore, the sample is not fully representative of  employees and employers in the federal jurisdiction.
Annex F - Employee rights and specific survey questions
The three employee rights under Part  II of the
Canada Labour Code
:
the  Right to know: Employees have  the right to be informed of known or foreseeable hazards in the work place and  to be provided with the information, instruction, training and supervision  necessary to protect their health and safety;
the  Right to participate: As health  and safety representatives or committee members, employees have the right and  the responsibility to participate in identifying and correcting job-related  health and safety concerns through an internal complaint resolution* process;  and
the  Right to refuse dangerous work: If  the person has reasonable cause to believe that a condition exists at work that  presents a danger to himself or herself; the use or operation of a machine or  thing presents a danger to the employee or a co-worker; and the performance of  an activity constitutes a danger to the employee or to another employee.

All responses were in the    90% - 100% range
All responses were in the    90% - 100% range
All responses were in the    70% to 80% range
Annex G - Federal jurisdiction sectors under Part II  of the
Canada Labour Code
Occupational health and safety in the federal jurisdiction  has been consolidated under Part II of the
Canada Labour Code
. The Code  applies to the following interprovincial and international industries, and  includes workplaces in the private and public sectors, including crown  corporations:
Railways
Highway transportation
Telephone and telegraph systems
Pipelines
Ferries, tunnels and bridges
Shipping and shipping services
Radio and television broadcasting and cable  systems
Airports
Banks
Grain elevators licensed by the Canadian Grain  Commission, and certain feed mills and feed warehouses, flour mills, and grain  seed cleaning plants
The federal public service and persons employed by the public service and about 40 Crown corporations and agencies
Employment in the operation of ships, trains and  aircraft
The exploration and development of petroleum on  lands subject to federal jurisdiction.
The federal public service and persons employed by the  public service, and more than 40 Crown corporations and agencies (as defined by  Part 3 of the
Federal Public Service Labour Relations Act
and Schedules  I, IV and V of the
Financial Administration Act
).
Part II of the
Canada Labour Code
does not apply to  certain undertakings regulated by the
Nuclear Safety and Control Act.
Annex H - Provincial, territorial and federal average  injury rates
The Disabling injury incidence rate* (federal) is the  combined rate of disabling and fatal injuries that occurred in federal  jurisdictional workplaces. This rate indicates that, as an annual average over  the 2011 to 2015 period, there were 1.76 full-time equivalents for every 100  full-time equivalents working under the federal jurisdiction that experienced  either a disabling injury or fatality.
The provincial and territorial average time-loss work injury  rates count only disabling injuries, also known as time-loss injury rates.

This targeting tool would not necessarily address the “severity” of the disabling injury. This tool would also help to optimize Program resources and likely reduce the Disabling Injury Incidence Rate* by up to 18%.
