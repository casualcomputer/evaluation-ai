This document presents the Office of Audit and Evaluation's (OAE) Departmental Evaluation Plan (DEP) for 2019-20 to 2023-24 for the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) and Health Canada (HC).
The DEP is updated annually to support the allocation of resources to a suite of evaluation projects over a five-year period, and is focused on Departmental and PHAC information needs. The development of this plan complies with requirements of the Treasury Board (TB)
Policy on Results (July 1, 2016)
. The projects contained within this plan were selected to ensure compliance with legislation and policy, support information needs, and consider risks in order to ensure the optimal use of resources.
The Departmental Results Frameworks (DRF), program inventories, and performance information profiles developed by each organization have formed the basis for this plan.
Planning for Evaluation
Over the next five years, the OAE plans to conduct 51 evaluations, 19 of which will cover PHAC activities and 23 of which will cover HC activities. In addition, OAE will participate in nine horizontal evaluations led by other government departments or agencies. A yearly breakdown is provided in
Table 1
, while
Table 2
provides an overview of the number of horizontal evaluations led by other government departments (OGDs) by year.
Appendices A and B
outline the direct program spending (DPS) by branch for all scheduled evaluation for the next five years for PHAC and for HC respectively.

Low Need: No requirement to inform major policy or spending decisions.
Low Risk: Low enterprise risk. For one program component, Health Canada is the delivery agent rather than program owner (Employee Assistance Services - EAS). EAS has been accredited with the highest quality standard (gold) of the industry as set out by the Employee Assistance Society of North America (EASNA) as the Council of Accreditation (COA) carries out in-depth assessments of EAS' compliance with best practices in the industry.
