Executive summary
As per the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat
Policy on Results
, Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC) must develop and publish an annual 5-year departmental evaluation plan. Informed by internal consultations and building on last year’s accomplishments, this plan targets the evaluation coverage of ESDC’s program spending for 2022 to 2027, with a focus on departmental risks, needs and priorities.
In 2021 to 2022, the Evaluation Directorate at ESDC continued to play an important role in the results agenda by fulfilling its mandate to evaluate the relevance and performance of departmental programs, policies, initiatives and services. The Directorate influenced policy and program design by conducting rigorous analysis, generating high quality evidence, disseminating knowledge, engaging with partners and providing trusted advice. It also continued to develop innovative approaches, including those that support the Government of Canada’s commitment to Gender-based Analysis Plus in both quantitative and qualitative evaluation design.

Challenges and opportunities for the evaluation function
In 2021 to 2022, the Evaluation function continued to operate in a context shaped by the COVID-19 pandemic. Among key challenges was the integration of new post-pandemic recovery measures as part of ongoing evaluations, as well as the availability and quality of data for certain programs.
On the other hand, the context of the pandemic also represented an opportunity for the function to carefully review the way it conducts evaluations to optimize their usefulness and value. Furthermore, ongoing departmental efforts in terms of collaboration with Statistics Canada to integrate administrative and survey data will eventually support the conduct of more valuable and relevant policy analysis, research and evaluation activities from a Gender-based Analysis Plus perspective.
Going forward
The Directorate plans to complete 15 evaluations in 2022 to 2023 and 9 evaluations in 2023 to 2024. In the years ahead, the Evaluation Directorate will continue to:
collaborate with policy and program officials
to provide timely evaluation evidence to inform decision makers
incorporate innovative methods
into its operations and the services it provides to the Department and other stakeholders, the measurement of the impacts of ESDC’s programs as well as for the dissemination of results

Introduction
Purpose of the Plan
The purpose of this Plan is to assist the Deputy Head by ensuring the availability of factual, neutral, and timely information on the Department’s programs and services. This information supports evidence-based decision-making and helps keep Canadians informed on departmental results. The Plan also helps ensure transparency in the decision making process for the evaluation function, highlighting priorities and coverage decisions.
This 5-year rolling Plan, required under the Treasury Board Policy on Results, is informed by an annual planning exercise that identifies the timing of the individual evaluations based on departmental needs, risks, and priorities.
To that end, the Evaluation Directorate is responsible for developing and implementing the Departmental Evaluation Plan. This includes:
reviewing various sources of information to identify all mandatory evaluations and assess coverage of the programs
consulting with program officials, key internal committees and Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat
assessing risk when determining the timing and order of future evaluations, prioritizing mandatory evaluations and evaluations that are most likely to inform major policy and program decisions
validating prioritization and securing final approval from the Deputy Head
monitoring and adapting to the changing departmental context and environment
Annex 1
provides more information about the Evaluation Planning Process.
Departmental context
ESDC’s mandate is to build a stronger and more inclusive Canada, to support Canadians in:
helping them live productive and rewarding lives
improving their quality of life
To that end, the Department delivers a range of programs and services that affect Canadians throughout their lives and across the country. The Department’s portfolio includes: (1) ESDC, (2) the Labour Program, and (3) Service Canada:
ESDC
delivers a range of programs and services that assist Canadians. For instance, it provides seniors with basic income security, supports unemployed workers while helping them return to employment, helps students to finance their post-secondary education and to transition to the labour market, and assists parents who are raising young children. The Department also assists persons with disabilities and their families.
The Labour Program
fosters safe, healthy, fair and inclusive work environments and cooperative workplace relations in the federal jurisdiction.
Service Canada
serves as a single point of access for some of the Government’s largest and most well known programs and services. This includes Employment Insurance, Old Age Security, Canada Pension Plan, the Social Insurance Number, and the Passport Program.
ESDC expenditures on programs and services totalled $252.3 billion in fiscal year 2020 to 2021. More than 95% of the departmental spending directly benefitted Canadians through Employment Insurance, the Canada Pension Plan, Old Age Security, Canada Emergency Response Benefits and other statutory transfer payment programs
Footnote

.
In fiscal year 2021 to 2022, ESDC continued providing support to Canadians facing hardship as a result of the global COVID-19 outbreak. In particular, the Department delivered a range of temporary COVID-19 recovery benefits to Canadians (for example, the Canada Recovery Benefit, the Canada Recovery Sickness Benefit, the Canada Recovery Caregiving Benefit, and the Canadian Workers Lockdown Benefit). The Department also implemented measures to support early learning and childcare, youth and helped Canadians to gain the foundational skills needed to succeed in today’s economy.
Evaluation directorate mandate
The Evaluation Directorate is mandated to evaluate the relevance and performance of departmental programs, policies, initiatives and services. The Directorate influences policy and program design through rigorous analysis and evidence presented in evaluation reports, as well as via technical reports, syntheses or supplemental studies. In that context, the Directorate works with program officials and senior management on the evaluation process through an inclusive approach to governance (
Annex 2
).
The Evaluation Directorate supports program officials
at all stages of the program and policy life cycle
:
at the
initial stage
, officials use evaluations to help inform the development of new programs and policies
during
implementation
, officials use evaluation recommendations to guide adjustments or program renewal
as a program or policy matures or
winds down
, officials can use evaluations to inform lessons learned for future programs or policies
The Evaluation Directorate occasionally advises program officials that are developing responses to the recommendations found in final reports. Lastly, the Directorate monitors progress on the implementation of action plans. This approach promotes a system of continuous improvement throughout the program and policy cycle.
Accomplishments in 2021 to 2022
While evaluation activities continued to be shaped by the COVID-19 pandemic, the evaluation team successfully received Performance Measurement and Evaluation Committee (PMEC) approval for evaluation reports, offered different evaluation products and services to meet information needs in the Department and contributed to the improvement of programs and services.
Supporting evidence-based decisions
Evaluation Directorate influenced and supported the Department evidence-based decision making by:
completing
10 evaluation reports
and
40 technical reports
to support program officials and the Employment Insurance Monitoring and Assessment Report 2019 to 2020
collaborating with provinces and territories on a bilateral and multilateral basis on the evaluation of the Labour Market Development Agreements and the Workforce Development Agreements to produce an additional
49 technical reports
advising on
37 Treasury Board Submissions
and
6 Memoranda to Cabinet
to inform policies and programs
incorporating innovative approaches and state of the art techniques in impact evaluation and cost-benefit analysis methodologies to address policy relevant questions
providing reliable and timely evaluation evidence to support labour market policy and program decisions, such as evidence regarding employment outcomes of Workforce Development Agreement participants before and during the COVID-19 pandemic
collaborating with program authorities and other groups within the Department, including the Chief Data Office, to optimize the availability and collection of data that can be used to support evaluation
obtaining thorough peer reviews for all evaluation results and evaluation methodologies used by the Directorate
Footnote
2
Disseminating and engaging
In 2021 to 2022, the Evaluation Directorate continued to disseminate knowledge and engage with partners inside and outside of the federal government. These activities included sharing knowledge through publications, presentations and engagement activities. To that end, the Directorate delivered 15 virtual presentations at 10 different national and international conferences and events, such as:
7 presentations
at the
Canadian Economic Association
conference, focusing on the methodology used and key results from several evaluations including: the incremental impacts for the Labour Market Development Agreements, an analysis of Employment Insurance benefits and job match quality, and the integration of Temporary Foreign Worker Program data into the Canadian Employer-Employee Dynamics Database
4 presentations
at the
Canadian Evaluation Society
conference, covering various topics on how to design the evaluation of a pilot, harness findings from qualitative methods to inform program effectiveness, leverage web analytics as a data collection strategy, and promote the utilization of evaluation results through various dissemination strategies
The Evaluation Directorate also:
published
2 technical reports
related to labour market programs for Persons with Disabilities and Indigenous peoples
collaborated with other federal departments or provincial/territorial governments on
6 evaluations
, including those led by ESDC or other federal departments
collaborated with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development on a project that will highlight how certain countries, like Canada, are leveraging administrative data to support impact evaluations. The report is expected to be released in 2022
strengthened and broadened its network with the academic community to explore new avenues of knowledge dissemination and collaboration
engaged in Federal/Provincial/Territorial discussions on results of various studies and best practices to design and deliver programs (for example, Labour Market Partnerships, Research and Innovation)
collaborated with ESDC’s Chief Data Office to share more data insights across the federal government
worked horizontally with Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat and other federal Heads of Evaluation
Acting as a trusted advisor
Over the course of 2021 to 2022, the Evaluation Directorate continued to provide trusted advice to program officials and senior management. The Directorate did this by:
providing advice on elements associated with the assessment and revision of
15 Performance Information Profiles
sharing technical reports and evaluations with policy developers across the Department to inform policy analysis and program improvements
providing advice and guidance to improve the use of a GBA Plus data collection and analysis lens to support the assessment of inequalities and determine whether diverse groups are well-served by our programs
participating in consultation activities on program design and delivery resulting from evaluation studies, in response to provincial and territorial requests
collaborating in the development of the draft Policy Framework for service to disadvantaged and under-served populations
The Evaluation Directorate also continued to support the Employment Insurance Commissioners for Employers and Workers in examining labour market issues and supporting the work of the Monitoring Report and Advisory Committee. In particular, the Directorate collaborated with the Employment Insurance Policy Directorate to:
provide input and analyze data for the annual Employment Insurance Monitoring and Assessment Report
produce supplemental studies to inform the Report (the Plan includes supplemental studies and internal analysis – the list is available in the annual
Monitoring and Assessment Report
)
prepare an annual work plan with members of the Monitoring Report and Advisory Committee
coordinate the call for study proposals and prioritize work for the 2021 to 2022 work plan
Given the scale and unique objectives of each Employment Insurance benefit, the Employment Insurance program is also subject to a number of evaluations.
Each year, the Evaluation Directorate administers a questionnaire to program officials following evaluations. In 2021 to 2022, the majority of respondents agreed that:
the evaluation contained valid, evidence-based findings and conclusions
the recommendations were realistic and actionable
the reports were clearly written
the evaluators were professional at all times in terms of competence, objectivity and knowledge
Evaluators are working to address areas where the Directorate rated lower such as providing officials with sufficient time to prepare documentation required for the evaluation and demonstrating a good understanding of the program’s operating environment.
Advancing innovative approaches and gender-based analysis plus (GBA Plus)
In 2021 to 2022, the Directorate pursued innovative practices to better estimate the impact of programs on specific sub-groups and disseminate results to inform decisions. Many of these practices strengthen the conduct of GBA Plus data collection and analysis.
The incorporation of GBA Plus analysis into evaluations can help identify barriers, faced by under-served and disadvantaged populations, to access programs and services, as well as data gaps.
For example, the evaluation of the Workforce Development Agreements provided significant evidence from the literature and from service providers about programs and services as well as additional supports that can assist specific sub-groups of participants with their integration into the labour market, including Persons with Disabilities, Older Workers, Youth, Indigenous people, Social Assistance Recipients and Newcomers.
The Directorate’s work in this area also included:
conducting virtual expert panels for the evaluation of the Enabling Accessibility Fund using a utilization and equity-focused approach. The Directorate held 3 expert panels, each of which focused on a theme relating to accessibility for a specific age group including youth, adults, and seniors
using innovative causal machine learning algorithms (such as the Modified Causal Forest Method) to learn how participants with various demographic backgrounds benefit differently from labour market programs and what works for whom
promoting the development of a qualitative methodology framework for GBA Plus across program areas
extending cost-benefit model to better account for the benefits associated with stronger labour market attachment, associated with certain employment benefits and support measures, on public health care spending
Furthermore, departmental efforts, led by the Chief Data Office, in close collaboration with Statistics Canada paved the way to the integration of administrative data (for example, Canada Emergency Response Benefits) and complementary survey data from Statistics Canada. The integration of administrative and survey data is an important development in terms of enabling the conduct of more valuable and relevant policy analysis, research and evaluation activities from a GBA Plus perspective.
Taken together, these recent developments will also better inform and contextualize the contribution of the Department’s programs and services to advance progress on the Sustainable Development Goals.
Evaluation coverage in 2021 to 2022
The Evaluation Directorate uses a risk-based approach when deciding the timing and scope of future evaluations. This approach prioritizes mandatory evaluations and evaluations that are most likely to inform major policy and program decisions.
In 2021 to 2022, the Evaluation Directorate completed the 10 planned evaluations, including those required under the
Financial Administration Act
as well as the
Policy on Results
Footnote

Consultations
The Evaluation Directorate conducted its annual consultation process for this Plan in November 2021 to identify key evaluation priorities, evidentiary needs, and timing of future evaluations. Officials from programs and with specialized expertise (for example, Head of Performance Measurement, Department’s research divisions, the Chief Data Office, and Internal Audit Services) participated in the discussions.
The 2021 consultations emphasized the need to:
take into consideration the
capacity constraints
of programs and reduce the burden on them
ensure the
complementarity
of oversight activities (for example, audits)
carefully review the
timing and scope
of proposed evaluations to optimize their usefulness and value
identify
lessons learned
from recently introduced measures to inform future policy/program design
leverage
linkages
between evaluation and research activities to inform evaluation projects, particularly in the area of service delivery
Using information obtained through the consultations, the Directorate has adjusted the plan put forward in 2020 to 2021 in light of new policy developments and priorities. As part of these consultations, the Directorate indicated that it will continue to:
develop additional approaches for measuring program impacts on disadvantaged groups
clarify the scope of evaluations to better meet program needs or adjust to program changes
liaise with program areas and the Head of Performance Measurement to stay up-to-date on changes in Performance Information Profiles to ensure policy relevance and appropriate data collection for evaluations
In addition, the consultation sessions facilitated collaboration among different groups within the Department who are involved with data in order to increase the availability and integration of data within the department. The evaluation planning process also included consultations with Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat’s officials undertaken in February 2022.
Risk assessment
Once mandatory evaluations have been scheduled, the Directorate considers additional discretionary evaluations using an analysis of risk, needs and priorities. Specifically, the Evaluation Directorate examines:
program risks (for example, size of the population affected or targeted by the program, knowledge gaps with respect to the program)
departmental risks identified in the Corporate Risk Profile
internal capacity constraints, such as the availability of staff
This multi-factor and multi-level approach ensures that evaluators consider the perspectives of key partners and stakeholders and internal risks. The Directorate considers key corporate risks for the Department, including the Risk-Based Audit Plan. In situations where audit and evaluation schedules overlap for the same program, the Evaluation Directorate collaborates with Internal Audit Services to ensure the complementarity of internal audit/evaluation activities. This provides a means of efficiently examining performance and outcomes.
Challenges and opportunities
The Plan is also based on an analysis of the environment in which the Evaluation Directorate is operating. This includes the quality and availability of program data and the impact of the operating context (for example, COVID-19).
Quality of data and performance measurement to support evaluations
Directorate evaluations depend on timely, quality data to produce useful evidence. Evaluators use performance measurement information and other data to determine the relevance of programs and services, and whether they deliver value for money. Evaluators also need better access to administrative data to be able to improve GBA Plus analysis for certain programs.
The ESDC Data Strategy, including the advancement of a joint ESDC-Statistics Canada Data Strategy, supports the implementation of the Departmental Evaluation Plan. The Evaluation Directorate works closely with ESDC’s Chief Data Office to ensure alignment with the strategy and collaboration on opportunities to maximize the ability to leverage data and analytics for evaluation purposes.
The Evaluation Directorate supports the Department Head of Performance Measurement in the development of
performance measurement and data collection practices
across the Department. In particular, evaluators advise PMEC, the Head of Performance Measurement and program officials on the quality of performance information in the
Performance Information Profiles
and its utility in supporting evaluations. The Profiles outline the performance measurement approach for each of ESDC’s program.
There is a need in the Department to improve access to external data sources and integrated data files, in keeping with the principles of Open Data. When data are available in a timely manner, they can be harnessed more effectively. This will ultimately enable improved policy and service delivery.
The Evaluation Directorate works closely with internal and external partners to enhance our Department’s data capacity through improved access to and integration of survey and administrative data. Recent examples include the integration of the Temporary Foreign Worker Program as well as the Apprenticeship database with Statistics Canada’s databases, and the development of the Labour Market Program Data Platform in collaboration with the Chief Data Office.
In addition, evaluators carefully address data issues when developing plans for program evaluations. These evaluability assessments or evaluation strategies include a review of a program’s performance information and the quality of data supporting the performance indicators. When data gaps that could hamper an evaluation are identified, evaluators work with officials to develop approaches to mitigate those challenges.
COVID-19 pandemic-related challenges
The Evaluation Directorate experienced specific challenges relating to the pandemic, including the temporary unavailability of data due to facility closures, adaptation to virtual data collection methods, the integration of COVID-19 measures into ongoing evaluations, and challenges relating to the evaluation of short-term measures. These challenges also represented an opportunity to continue moving towards a more agile evaluation function.
Human resources capacity
In 2021 to 2022, the Evaluation Directorate had 70.78 full time equivalents. To meet short-term capacity demands, the Directorate uses flexible staffing tools such as hiring students, casual employees and consultants to fill specific capacity gaps.
Resource allocation
In 2022 to 2023, Evaluation’s budget remains largely unchanged from fiscal year 2021 to 2022. The forecasted amount for salary expenditures for fiscal year 2022 to 2023 is $6.20M and forecasted operations and maintenance is $1.50M. The Directorate will continue to focus on providing advice and planning evaluations of new and modified programs and services in addition to undertaking previously planned evaluations. It will manage its resources prudently and remain flexible in order to ensure it is capable of handling potential changes relating to the pandemic over the near term.
