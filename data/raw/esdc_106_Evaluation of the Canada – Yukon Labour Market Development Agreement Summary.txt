Key results for active claimants
Skills Development Employment Benefit is effective at
improving earnings and incidence of employment
among active claimants (compared to non-participants)
Employment Assistance Services are effective at
improving earnings and reducing EI use
among active claimants (compared to non-participants)
For active claimants, the
social benefits of participation exceeded the cost of investments
in both programs over time
Key results for former claimants
Some former claimants participants do not appear to be benefiting from the programs. The
proportion of participants employed is lower
after participation. This is due in part to local conditions and retirement decisions of older participants.
Former claimants participants showed
higher average earnings and lower average proportions on EI and social assistance
after participation (compared to pre-participation levels)
Evaluation reports
