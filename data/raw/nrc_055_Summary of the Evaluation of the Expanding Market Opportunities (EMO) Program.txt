EVALUATION OF NATURAL RESOURCE CANADA’S EXPANDING MARKET OPPORTUNITIES (EMO) PROGRAM
About The Program
The objective of the Expanding Market Opportunities (EMO) program is to diversify international markets for Canadian forest products (reducing dependence on the United States) and promote increased wood use in North American non-residential and mid-rise construction.
Delivered by Natural Resources Canada’s Canadian Forest Service, this contribution program cost-shares market access and development activities with forest industry associations and other stakeholders. Actual expenditures over the period of evaluation were $69 million.
What The Evaluation Found
Relevance
The program continues to be relevant and well aligned with NRCan roles, responsibilities and priorities. Overall, it is responsive to the needs of the forest sector. However, there are barriers to effective engagement with the nascent bioproducts sector.

Effectiveness
There has been continued progress towards the program’s intended outcomes for both international and domestic markets. Targets to increase the value of wood product sales in both key international and domestic markets are being met.
Target Market
>2011 to 2017
Key international markets
>16.1%
($3.1B to $3.6B)
Domestic non-residential construction
>25%
($130.3 M to $162.8 M)

Infographic showing the breakdown of exports of Canadian forest products in 2017: 29% were softwood lumber, 23% wood pulp, 7% structural wood panels, 6% printing and writing paper, 6% newsprint, and 29% other (includes over 400 categories of products). Source: State of Canada’s Forests (2018).
Domestically, increased adoption and commercialization of wood could be facilitated by increasing the reach of the program’s information resources to new target audiences (e.g., the insurance industry). While the environmental reputation of Canada’s wood products continues to be well regarded internationally, more could be done to communicate this performance domestically.
Moving forward, it will also be important to ensure that the program’s international activities are aligned to NRCan’s new International Departmental Plan.
Efficiency
Overall, the EMO program continues to be delivered efficiently and economically. However, the need for continual program renewal hinders the efficiency of the program and limits the effective use of multi-year agreements. Opportunities also exist to significantly strengthen and streamline the EMO program’s performance measurement system, including integration of considerations for gender-based analysis plus in data collection.

About the Evaluation
The evaluation covers the period  from 2015-16 to 2018-19. The purpose of the evaluation was to:
Confirm ongoing program relevance and  performance;
Review changes in context and delivery since the  last evaluation (2016) and the impact of these changes on 

program effectiveness or efficiency,  including consideration of gender-based analysis plus; and
Identify the impact of management actions in  response to the past evaluation.
This evaluation is consistent  with the requirement of the Treasury Board Policy on Results (2016).
Details on specific evaluation  questions, methods and limitations are found in the full report.
Recommendations and Management Response and Action Plan
The Canadian Forest Service should work with  partners to address gaps in market research identified by the evaluation and  program stakeholders, including developing forward insights into market  opportunities for new bioproducts.
Agreed.
The  Canadian Forest Service will consult with partners to identify and address gaps  in the program’s current suite of market studies and strategies, including the  market development needs of the emerging bioproducts sector. Due date:  March 2023.
The Canadian Forest Service should review its  pilot of in-market infrastructure in the Middle East, ensuring that it is  aligned with NRCan’s broader international strategy. CFS should also share its  lessons learned from this review so as to inform NRCan’s implementation of  similar positions in other sectors.
Agreed.
In April 2019 the Canadian  Forest Service contracted with a consulting firm specializing in evaluation and  performance management to perform an impact assessment of the pilot in-market  infrastructure in the Middle East. Lessons learned will inform the future of  the pilot and be shared within the department at the Directors General  International Affairs Committee. Due date: March 2020.
The Canadian Forest Service should work with  domestic partners to extend outreach to new target audiences in the delivery of  the North American Markets component, including considerations for more  innovative use of online media.
Agreed.
The Canadian Forest Service  will work with domestic partners to increase engagement with different target  groups in the delivery of the North American Markets component. This includes  launching new education programs with insurers, information campaigns on the  implications of the 2020 National Building Code, and investing in enhancements  to the Think Wood online communications platform as well as those of other  industry stakeholders. Due date: May 2020.
The Canadian Forest Service should work with  partners to increase communication of the forest industry’s environmental  performance within Canada and the domestic marketing of wood as a preferred  option for sustainable construction.
Agreed.
The Canadian Forest Service  will work with partners to improve communication of the forest industry’s  environmental performance within Canada and the domestic marketing of wood as a  preferred option for sustainable construction. The program will partner with  industry on a National Sustainability Coordinator position at the Canadian Wood  Council that will increase awareness and reduce/remove barriers and  misinformation related to wood use in sustainable construction, and to position  wood as the building material of choice, based on science.  Due date: May 2020.
The Canadian Forest Service should strengthen  and streamline the EMO program’s performance measurement system, to reduce  reporting burden and improve clarity of its performance story. This should  include integration of GBA+ considerations in data collection.
Agreed.
Work is underway to strengthen and streamline the  performance measurement system and performance metrics, including GBA+  considerations, as part of the renewal efforts of Budget 2019. Due date: March  2020.
