About the program
Pathways to Education is a charitable organization working with at-risk youth in low-income communities to improve their educational outcomes.
Lessons learned
Targeted early interventions can positively affect vulnerable populations
A key component of the success of the Pathways model is the flexibility to adapt to local needs and conditions
Early interventions with vulnerable populations can generate long-term net benefits with a high social rate of return, not just for individuals, but also for governments
Key findings
After 20.8 years
The discounted benefit to society is equal to the costs of the program
After 22.5 years
Pathways to Education breaks even from a government perspective, with the discounted benefits of the program equalling the costs
After 25 years
The discounted benefit of a student participating in Pathways is $7,490
The social rate of return for a student’s participation in Pathways is 50.1 percent
Note:
Does not include other potential societal gains related to improved social outcomes, such as reduced health spending and intergenerational effects.

Pathways  to Education 2017 Results Summary
Figure 2: Net social cost-benefit analysis 25 years after participation
Text description of Figure 2
The graph shows how costs and benefits of Pathways accrue to both individual participants and to governments, over the short- and long-term. From individuals’ perspective, short-term benefits such as education subsidies and improved skills/employability can offset short-term costs incurred due to participation. Long-term benefits for individuals consist of greater lifetime earnings and improved social outcomes. From the government’s perspective, short-term costs consist of program costs and costs of supporting higher levels of education. Benefits to the government begin in the medium-term and extend into the long-term, and include the following: increased tax revenues from greater lifetime earnings of participants; decreased outlay on Employment Insurance, Social Assistance etc. and a potential decrease in spending on social programs, such as justice and health of individuals.
