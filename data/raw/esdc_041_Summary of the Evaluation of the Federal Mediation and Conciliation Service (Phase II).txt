About the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service
The Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service is responsible for providing dispute resolution and dispute prevention assistance to unions and employers under the jurisdiction of the Canada Labour Code.
Key findings
The Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service played a significant role in helping employer and union organizations resolve collective bargaining disputes
The majority (95%) of cases were settled successfully, without a work stoppage
Work stoppages cannot always be avoided. The length and outcome of collective bargaining disputes were influenced by various factors, outside the mediatorâ€™s control
Conciliation and mediation services helped maintain and improve labour-management relations
Program resources as well as the extensive structural program changes implemented during the evaluation period supported the delivery of conciliation and mediation services
Following the last evaluation in 2014, the program implemented several changes. A new performance measurement strategy, new tools and supporting documents ensure that data collection, storage and reporting is more consistent and streamlined
