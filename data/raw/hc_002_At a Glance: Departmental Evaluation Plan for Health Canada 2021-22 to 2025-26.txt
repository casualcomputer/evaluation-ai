The Office of Audit and Evaluation (OAE) Departmental Evaluation Plan for Health Canada describes the Program Evaluation Division's scheduled work for the five-year period from 2021-22 to 2025-26. The Plan was developed to meet Health Canada's commitments under the
Policy on Results
(2016), which requires that each department prepare a five-year plan that is updated annually.
The projects included in this Evaluation Plan were selected to ensure full coverage of all Grant and Contribution spending over $5 million annually over a five-year period, prior commitments in Treasury Board Submissions, the information needs of program management, and program risks, and optimal use of resources. The Departmental Results Framework (DRF), program inventory, and performance information profiles developed by Health Canada have formed the basis for this plan.
The COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a significant impact on the work of Health Canada (HC) as it remains at the forefront of the Government of Canada's response. To be respectful of the need for branches to focus on the response, and to respond to other oversight reviews such as those led by the Office of the Auditor General and the Standing Committee on Health, OAE reprioritized work and, as necessary and where possible, shifted the timing of planned evaluations.
The present Departmental Evaluation Plan (DEP) reflects the response of OAE to these circumstances, by developing a plan that ensures that OAE focuses its efforts and resources on emerging priorities while continuing to meet our reporting commitments under the
Financial Administration Act
(FAA).
Planning for Evaluation
Over the next  five years, the OAE plans to conduct 29 evaluations that involve Health Canada:  19 will focus exclusively on Health Canada activities and two evaluations will  examine the activities of both Health Canada and the Public Health Agency of  Canada (PHAC). The remaining eight projects are horizontal evaluations â€“ three  of which are led by Health Canada and the remaining five projects are led by  other government departments or agencies. A yearly breakdown is provided in
Table 1

Low Need: HC's activities have focused on the administration of the Act, such as monitoring for compliance. On an annual basis, the federal Minister of Health is required to report to Parliament on the administration and operation of the Canada Health Act, which provides good oversight on this activity.

Low Need: No requirement to inform major policy or spending decisions.
Low Risk: Low enterprise risk. For one program component, Health Canada is the delivery agent rather than program owner (Employee Assistance Services - EAS). EAS has been accredited with the highest quality standard (gold) of the industry as set out by the Employee Assistance Society of North America (EASNA) as the Council of Accreditation (COA) carries out in-depth assessments of EAS' compliance with best practices in the industry.
