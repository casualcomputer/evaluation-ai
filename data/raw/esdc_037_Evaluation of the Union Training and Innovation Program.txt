Executive summary
The Union Training and Innovation Program was launched in 2017 and 2018 and allotted $110 million over 5 years and an ongoing $25 million annually to support union-based apprenticeship training, innovation and enhanced partnerships.
The Program aims to strengthen union-based apprenticeship training by sharing with unions the cost of training equipment and supporting innovative approaches to address challenges that limit apprenticeship outcomes. The Program is currently delivered through the following funding streams:
Stream 1 (Investments in Training Equipment) provides unions with up to 50% of the cost to purchase new, up-to-date equipment/materials needed for training workers in the Red Seal trades
Footnote

Stream 2 (Innovation
Footnote

in Apprenticeship) provides support for innovative approaches and enhanced partnerships to address long-standing challenges
Footnote
3
limiting apprenticeship outcomes. This stream is open to a range of stakeholders and partners. However, unions representing workers in Red Seal trades must be involved, either as the lead or as a partner on projects
For both Streams, projects focus on the participation and success of key groups. For example:
women
Indigenous Peoples
newcomers
persons with disabilities
visible minorities
Involve broad-based partnerships with:
employers
community and non-profit groups
training providers
provinces and territories
Indigenous communities
colleges
Overall, the Program has invested $127.4M during the evaluation period and funded 217
Footnote

projects. From 2017 to the end of 2019 and 2020, approximately 24,300 participants have participated in these projects. Additionally, a separate contribution agreement with the province of Quebec committed $11.9M during the same period through, but this agreement is outside the scope of this evaluation.
The current evaluation assesses the Program's design, implementation and early achievements. It covers the period from the program's inception in fiscal year 2017 and 2018 to fiscal year 2020 and 2021

. The evaluation satisfies the
Financial Administration Act
requirement to evaluate the Program on a 5 year cycle.
Key findings
The budget was spent as planned to fund projects under Stream 1 and Stream 2. The funding focussed on projects that improved the quality of training in the trades, addressed barriers limiting participation and success in trades training and careers, and enhanced partnerships
The budget was allocated to fund 217 projects of both streams (excluding Quebec), through 6 calls for proposals, held annually in 2017 to 2018, 2018 to 2019, and 2019 to 2020.
45% of unions funded in Stream 1 have partnered with other unions, and 38% of recipients funded in Stream 2 have partnered with Indigenous organizations for the delivery of their respective projects.
By geographical and zonal distribution of funding, the Program contributed to reducing barriers to access trades training. However, Ontario had the largest number of funded projects
The 2019 and 2020 Federal Apprenticeship Programs Survey report reveals that Ontario had the largest number of funded projects (38) followed by British Columbia with 11 projects.
The regional distribution of projects is also consistent with the distribution of registered /continuing apprentices across Canada as presented in the 2019 Registered Apprenticeship Information System.
The majority of the funding recipients indicated they were satisfied with the funding they received as part of the Program
The recipients said they were satisfied with the services provided by the Program and the responsive timing of the calls for proposals. Overall, it met their organizations' needs.
56% of the interviewees reported that Indigenous Peoples had access to the training, equipment and materials funded, as a result of these type of innovative approaches
The majority of funding recipients used various innovative approaches to advertise their training opportunities and to help increase participation. For example, they developed a digital marketing recruitment strategy through social media like Facebook. They also promoted their training at trade shows, job fairs and information sessions.
In addition, some funding recipients worked with existing members and women mentors as role models to encourage women to enter apprenticeship training. This has been very successful.
In 2019 and 2020, the Program exceeded the targeted number of projects participants by 24%
The Program reached the targeted number of participants for winter 2019 and exceeded it by 24% for 2019 and 2020. The 2019 and 2020 Federal Apprenticeship Program Survey results show that between its inception in 2017 and 2018 to 2019 and 2020, 24,267 individuals have participated in funded projects in Streams 1 and 2. Out of this number, 26% of total participants were from key groups.
In addition, in fiscal year 2019 and 2020, a total of 17,147 individuals participated in funded projects (15,415 in Stream 1 and 1,713 in Stream 2). In this same fiscal year, 54% of total participants in Stream 1 projects, and 56% of Stream 2 projects are continuing their apprenticeships. Funding recipients also reported an increase in participant skills after program intervention – 67% of participants in Stream 1, and 82% in Stream 2, respectively. Almost 100% of participants in Stream 1, and 52% in Stream 2 are employed in a Red Seal trade.
Although a performance framework was in place, there were limitations in performance measurement reporting
The Program has a performance measurement framework, which include a logic model, indicators and data collection tools. In order to fulfill their reporting requirements stated in the contribution agreements, the funding recipients are required to submit Key Performance Indicator reports to the Department.
The project files review conducted in 2021 revealed that even though the Key Performance Indicators were collected through the annual Federal Apprenticeship Program Survey, minimal information on those indicators can be found in the Common System for Grants and Contributions (CSGC). Only 1 final report was found completed during the evaluation reporting period.
Recommendations
Improve the Program's performance monitoring, data collection and performance records
The project file review conducted in 2021 assessed projects that had been ongoing for more than 1 year
Footnote
6
. This review revealed that the required project specific data and information from recipients were not available in the Common System for Grants and Contributions.
According to the 2019 and 2020 Federal Apprenticeship Programs Survey Report, some of the funding recipients indicate they are experiencing difficulty collecting and recording data on the number of individuals from key groups in their projects. This may be due, in part, to a lack of understanding of their own responsibilities and authorities to collect data on key groups and hesitancy from those groups in disclosing their heritage or background.
Explore how other apprenticeship trainings could target regions where union involvement in training is less prevalent
The regional distribution of projects is consistent with the fact that for both Stream 1 and Stream 2, Ontario has had the largest number of union training centres.
Other provinces and territories where training is almost universally provided through public institutions have relatively few union training centres and have benefited less from the Program funding (such as Alberta, Manitoba).
Management response and action plan
Overall management response
Employment and Social Development Canada's Skills and Employment Branch and the Program Operations Branch would like to thank the individuals who contributed to the evaluation of the Union Training and Innovation Program (UTIP), particularly the members of the Evaluation Directorate, as well as all interview participants who provided their insights as part of this evaluation.
Launched in 2017, Union Training and Innovation Program Streams 1 and 2 support union-based apprenticeship training, innovation and enhanced partnerships in the Red Seal trades. The Investments in Training Equipment Stream (Stream 1) provides unions with up to 50% of the cost of new, up-to-date equipment and materials that meet industry standards or investment in technology in the Red Seal trades; and the Innovation in Apprenticeship Stream (Stream 2) provides support for innovative approaches and enhanced partnerships to address longstanding challenges limiting apprenticeship outcomes.
The evaluation found that the program was implemented to achieve its objectives, the majority of the funding recipients indicated they were satisfied with the funding they received as part of the Program, the Program has made progress in fostering innovation in the delivery of projects, and the Program has contributed to the achievement of its outcomes related to employment in a skilled trade and continuing in apprenticeship.
Employment and Social Development Canada agrees with the evaluation's 2 recommendations to:
improve the Program's performance monitoring, data collection and performance records
explore how other apprenticeship training could target regions where union involvement in training is less prevalent
Recommendation #1
Improve the Program's performance monitoring, data collection and performance records.
Management response
Management agrees with this recommendation.
To ensure projects are meeting their activities' objectives, and to monitor risk management requirements, recipients report to the Program Operations Branch on project activities, outputs and outcomes on a quarterly basis.
Building on current efforts, the Program will continue to collect data through the annual Federal Apprenticeship Programs Survey.
Since 2019, Skills and Employment Branch and Program Operations Branch have worked together to develop and collect data through the Federal Apprenticeship Programs Survey. Each year, the Federal Apprenticeship Programs Survey gathers annual data on KPIs and identifies lessons learned and best practices to support policy program development and decision-making. The survey approach helps to collect consistent and rich data throughout the lifecycle of the projects, enabling effective analysis of the program. The Federal Apprenticeship Programs Survey response rate for Union Training and Innovation Program was 83% in 2019 to 2020 and 92% in 2020 to 2021.
Union Training and Innovation Program funding recipients indicated challenges with collecting data on key groups participants, including women, newcomers, Indigenous people and Persons with Disabilities. A few recipients reported uncertainty with their roles and responsibilities in requesting information from participants.
In addition, the data collection on key groups is provided on a voluntary self-identification basis. While voluntary self-identification is important, it makes it difficult for the Program to validate the information provided by program beneficiaries.
Skills and Employment Branch and Program Operations Branch are planning to provide more information during the information sessions for Calls for Proposals to highlight recipient roles and responsibilities in collecting information on key groups, as part of the funding process. The Program Operations Branch will also provide more guidance to the recipient during the negotiations and signing of the agreement, where the content of the agreement including clauses and the reporting requirements, are explained.
Management action plan
1.1 - Continue to conduct the Federal Apprenticeship Programs Survey to collect the annual KPIs data; explore ways to improve the response rate to the Federal Apprenticeship Programs Survey; and to record the collected data in an effective manner.
Lead:
Skills and Employment Branch and Programs Operations Branch
Completion date:
Ongoing
1.2 - Provide information during the information sessions for Call for Proposals and meetings leading up to the start of the project to highlight recipient responsibilities and authorities in collecting information on key groups
Lead:

Completion date:
Ongoing
Recommendation #2
Explore how other apprenticeship training could target regions where union involvement in training is less prevalent.
Management response
Management agrees with this recommendation.
The regional distribution of Union Training and Innovation Program projects reflects areas where the highest number of union training centres are located
Footnote
7
. Ontario has the largest number of centres. In jurisdictions where training is traditionally provided through public institutions, there are relatively few union training centres. These regions are less likely to benefit from Union Training and Innovation Program funding (for example, Alberta, Manitoba and the Territories).
The Canadian Apprenticeship Strategy, announced in Budget 2019, aims to ensure that ESDC's existing apprenticeship supports and programs—including the Union Training and Innovation Program —address the barriers to entry and progression for those who want to work in the skilled trades in the most effective way, and support employers who face challenges in hiring and retaining apprentices.
ESDC will identify opportunities under the Canadian Apprenticeship Strategy to target investments to remove barriers and get more Canadians the hands-on experience and apprenticeship training they need to build good, well-paying careers in the skilled trades, including in regions where union involvement in apprenticeship training is less prevalent.

Key evaluation results
The main findings from the evaluation include:
the budget was spent as planned to fund projects under Stream 1 and Stream 2. The funding focussed on projects that improved the quality of training in the trades, addressed barriers limiting participation and success in trades training and careers, and enhanced partnerships
by geographical and zonal distribution of funding, the Program contributed to reducing barriers to access trades training. However, Ontario had the largest number of funded projects
the majority of the funding recipients indicated they were satisfied with the funding they received as part of the Program
56% of the interviewees reported that Indigenous Peoples had access to the training, equipment and materials funded, as a result of these type of innovative approaches
in 2019 and 2020, the Program exceeded the targeted number of projects participants by 24%
although a performance framework was in place, there were limitations in performance measurement reporting
Based on these findings, the evaluation recommends the following:
improve the Program's performance monitoring, data collection and performance records
explore how other apprenticeship trainings could target regions where union involvement in training is less prevalent
Program background
Launched in 2017, the Union Training and Innovation Program provides $25 million annually, through grants and contributions. The Program supports union-based apprenticeship training, innovation and partnerships in the Red Seal trades through 2 streams of funding:
Stream 1: Investments in training equipment
provides unions with up to 50% of the cost of new equipment and materials to meet industry standards or investments in technology in the Red Seal trades. This Stream will lead to a more skilled, inclusive, certified and productive trades' workforce
Stream 2: Innovation in apprenticeship
provides support for innovative approaches to address long-standing challenges limiting apprenticeship outcomes.
Specifically, the Union Training and Innovation Program was designed to:
complement existing initiatives by focusing on new areas for investment such as encouraging innovation in apprenticeship training systems
contribute to the objective of improving apprenticeship outcomes which include helping apprentices progress and certify in the Red Seal trades, particularly for key groups such as:
Indigenous Peoples
women
persons with disabilities
racialized communities, such as:
Black Canadians
newcomers
The Program objectives are:
to improve the quality of training in the trades
address barriers limiting participation and success in trades training and careers
enhance partnerships between stakeholders
The Union Training and Innovation Program Funding recipients include:
unions representing workers in Red Seal trades
organizations managing training funds for Red Seal trades workers
for-profit and not-for-profit organizations
Indigenous organizations (including band councils, tribal councils and self-government entities)
municipal, provincial and territorial governments, institutions agencies and Crown Corporations
Since the launch of the Program in fiscal year 2017 and 2018 to December 2020,
217 projects
were funded for a total of
$127.4 million

projects funded
The Program continues to support the Red Seal trades:
217 projects (not including Quebec) were approved from when the program was first launched in fiscal year 2017 and 2018 to fiscal year 2020 and 2021
The budget was allocated to fund projects of both streams
Stream 1:
The number of funded projects has varied from year to year since the Program launch while the number of applications received has remained roughly the same. There is a vast range in the overall project budget proposals, which influences the number of organizations that can be funded annually
Stream 2:
There were no calls for proposals in 2018 and 2019, and the number of projects funded has been approximately the same. However, amount funded increased from 19 approved ($27.4M in 2017 to 2018) to 16 projects ($56M in 2020 to 2021)

According to the 2019 and 2020 Federal Apprenticeship Program Survey Report, the Union Training and Innovation Program's
$127.4 million
funding has been awarded through 6 calls for proposals.
Out of
334 applications received
, demonstrating a real need and interest, a total of 217 projects were funded:
182 projects in Stream 1
35 projects in Stream 2
There is the potential for a
rapid increase of funding requested for projects in the years to come.
That could lead to a big gap between the total funding ask versus total funding available for investment because:
the Program becomes well known
many organizations may seek Government support as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, Stream 2 projects calls for proposals tend to be larger in scope and overall project budget value
51% of funding recipients reported having at least 1 partner. According to the Key Informant Interviews report, the Program helped build and strengthen partnerships
One of the Program's objectives is to enhance partnerships between stakeholders
The key informant interviews and document review reported that the Program contributed to improved relationships between funding recipients and their partners
A few Program officials mentioned that partners with access to key groups helped to increase the number of participants who identify as:
women
Indigenous Peoples
newcomers
people with disabilities
Benefits:
the
majority
of funding recipients interviewed said
applying for the Program funding positively influenced their relationships with partners
:
for example, the recipients consulted with their partners when designing their proposals
because of the Program, some recipients
reached out
to partners that represented or had access to the Program's target populations
finally, some recipients mentioned that as a result of the Program,
they developed strong relationships with partners. Partners
included the United Association, contractors, suppliers, colleges and school boards:
a few recipients said that partners
provided job opportunities for apprentices
Challenges:
a few interviewees noted the difficulty of building their partnerships because:
some key groups, such as Indigenous groups, and communities have not had experience working with unions
the unions did not understand the needs of these groups
a few Program officials also noted that funding recipients'
partners could fall off or move on.
This is because projects had not been approved in a timely manner, as a result of bureaucratic delays at ESDC
The Program helped to enhance partnerships between stakeholders and partners
It was expected that:
50% of projects in the Stream 1 would involve a partnership
10% of partners would have increased their financial investment over year prior to intervention
Stream 2 projects that are union led are not required to have partners, however non-union led projects must have a union partnership
Many funding recipients have partnered with more than 1 partner institution, organization or union.

By geographical distribution of funding, the Program contributed to reducing barriers to access trades training. However, Ontario had the largest number of funded projects.
Organizations in all provinces and territories are eligible to apply for the Program funding
except for organizations from the province of Quebec. In Quebec, apprenticeship training is solely undertaken in the public school system prior to registering with an employer as an apprentice, and unions do not provide training to apprentices

other provinces and territories where training is almost universally provided through public institutions have relatively few union training centres. They have benefited less from the Program funding (such as Alberta, Manitoba)
although applications were not submitted by organizations from Yukon, Nunavut, Northwest Territories and Prince Edward Island,
participants from these provinces and territories are included in other projects
such as mobile training delivered in remote communities or a regional training council through their membership
Zonal distribution of Program funding contributed to reducing barriers to access trades training.
According to the 2019 and 2020 Federal Apprenticeship Programs Survey results, funding recipients in both Stream 1 and Stream 2 operate in different communities
Footnote
17
:
93% are currently operating in urban communities
while 38% are operating in rural communities
11% on Indigenous reserves
The fact that about half of funding recipients operate their projects in rural communities and/or on Indigenous reserves might
indicate that the program contributes to reducing geographical barriers to access trades training.
The

Client satisfaction
The key informant interviews revealed that funding recipients were satisfied with the services provided by the Program and the responsive timing of the calls for proposals
The majority of Union Training and Innovation Program recipients reported that that the timing of the
calls for proposals met their organizations' needs
Some of them stated that
the Program came at the right time when they needed to purchase or upgrade their equipment and materials
During application process:
the majority of the funding recipients interviewed mentioned that the Program
application process was simple and straightforward
evaluation findings show that the funding recipients
received support
from Program officials through various channels during the application process
since 2019,
information sessions
were held during each Call for Proposal
In addition:
some recipients expressed that the proposals
took a long time
to be processed and the projects to be accepted
a few recipients shared that it
was difficult to navigate
through the online application forms and design
During projects' implementation:
According to the 2021 Union Training and Innovation Program Key Informant Interviews:
the majority of the funding recipients indicated that they were
satisfied with the support and communication they received from ESDC
during their projects
some recipients indicated
delays or lack of responses when contacting ESDC agents
a few of them said there was
not enough communication in regards to funding claims during the pandemic
A few recipients shared concerns about
ESDC staff turnover
related to their projects
There was a feeling of lack of consistency related to expectations and requirements by new agents handling projects
Stakeholders' suggestions for improving program design and implementation
Document review reveals that Program officials have held several meetings with stakeholders over the years to obtain their feedback on federal apprenticeship programs and supports.
Stakeholder experience with Program design and implementation:
in general,
Union Representatives
indicated that support for union-based apprenticeship training through the Program is effective, especially under Stream 1. Because keeping up with advances in technology for training equipment can be expensive
however, some of them have expressed concerns that
the terms and conditions of the Program were unclear and not as flexible
as they could have been. Therefore, it was challenging to justify the purchase of certain types of equipment needed for their training (example: computers)
other stakeholders, such as employers, some associations of training providers and not-for-profit organizations
expressed that they could also benefit from financial support to update equipment in order to ensure alignment with labour market needs. They also noted that Program
criteria should be more flexible
some stakeholders, representing open shop (non-union) employers, expressed concern that non-union employers would likely not send their employees to a union facility for training; although they believe the Program design did seek to address inclusivity by having wider eligibility criteria for non-union involvement for the Stream 2 funding
some provinces and territories
through the Canadian Council of Directors of Apprenticeship have raised concerns about the focus on unions. Particularly they mentioned the variances in union training centres and the presence of unions between provinces and territories (example: little presence in the North)
concerns were expressed
about potential duplication of efforts and the need for better communication about projects.
The provinces and territories would ideally be consulted on selection and approval of projects in their jurisdictions
Section 2: Program outcomes
These findings addressed the following evaluation questions:
to what extent is the program fostering innovation in the delivery of Streams 1 and 2?
to what extent did the program effectively achieve its expected outcome of improving program participants' labour market outcomes in the Red Seal trades?

Key findings
Innovation
The Program has made progress in fostering innovation resulting in up to date/innovative training equipment and materials
According to the key informant interviews,
Program funding resulted in new, up-to-date/innovative training equipment and materials:
67%
of Program officials said the Program funding was used for
new and current technology
such as simulator, virtual reality, and remote control machine
Stream 1:
76%
of the interviewees implemented innovative approaches to design their projects. For example, they
consulted their partners and committees to determine equipment
and materials to include in projects:
a few of them also
consulted apprentices, attended trade shows and reviewed trade publication
when drafting their proposals
some recipients said the trainees had the chance to work with up-to-date equipment and new technologies purchased with the program's funding
Program funding resulted in fostering innovation in apprenticeship training
According to the second
Footnote
18
Call for Proposals for Stream 2:
innovation aims to address challenges limiting apprenticeships outcomes for Red Seal trades using innovation and/or best practices by:
using a new approach
changing an existing approach
scaling of best practices
The key informant interviews and the 2019 and 2020 Federal Apprenticeship Programs Survey supported that the majority of funding recipients used the following approaches to advertise their training opportunities and to help increase participation:
posting at partners' locations including:
Service Canada employment offices
Indigenous organizations
YMCAs
schools
digital marketing recruitment strategy through social media (Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter), and recipient's website
promoting training at trade shows, job fairs and information sessions
using various communication channels:
newsletters
membership meeting
flyers
calendar updates
phone calls or text messages
Additional innovative actions implemented as part of the Union Training and Innovation Program included:
purchasing a mobile training classroom
to bring the training to different communities.
56%
of the interviewees reported that Indigenous Peoples had access to the training, equipment and materials funded, as a result of this type of innovative approaches:
expansion of the Aboriginal Apprenticeship Board of Ontario web portal to 4 additional provinces
to offer employment services to Indigenous Peoples in:
New Brunswick
Saskatchewan
Alberta
British Columbia
utilization of existing and past trainees as
mentors
to advertise trainings through testimonials and encourage program participation:
for women, newcomers and Indigenous Peoples
, mentorship was crucial in recruiting new members
some funding recipients worked with existing members and
women mentors as role models
to encourage females to enter the apprenticeships training. This has been very successful
Program outreach
In 2019 and 2020, the Program exceeded the targeted number of projects participants by 24%
The Program
met its short-term target.
This shows that combined effort of program administrators and funding recipients led to the
successful implementation of innovative projects.
These projects help to increase Canadians participation and success in the skilled trades.
The Federal Apprenticeship Programs Survey data indicates that in 2019 and 2020, a total of
17,147
individuals participated in both streams of the Program's projects led by funding recipients
Since the inception of the Programs in 2017, a total of
24,267
individuals have enrolled in all funded projects
The Program met the targeted number of participants for winter 2019, and exceeded it by 24% for 2019 and 2020.
Targets:
between 4,500 and 10,000 participants by winter 2019
between 10,000 and 13,000 participants per year starting in 2019 and 2020

The Program has contributed to improve participants' skills to succeed in the Red Seal Trades.
According to the 2020 Union Training and Innovation Program Key Informant Interviews:
Stream 1:
most
funding recipients interviewees
noticed improvements in the skills
of the people who have participated in the training
almost all
recipients interviewed said the equipment and training
helped prepare participants
for the skills needs and technological developments of the labour market
most
funding recipients interviewed mentioned that project
participants benefited
in their careers after having participated in the projects.
"The equipment training is as realistic as it can possibly get, and it moves them along and gives them the ability to be more highly trained in the competition of apprentices. People who come in to do our trainings from the Union Training and Innovation Program equipment certainly moved ahead of others." – Stream 1 interviewee
Stream 2:
all funding recipients interviewed noticed improvements in the skills of the people who have participated in the training
most recipients interviewed said the equipment and training helped prepare participants for the skills needs and technological developments of the labour market
most funding recipients interviewed said that the equipment, materials and innovative training from the projects helped participants to move on to the next step in their training and apprenticeship
"We have observed participants during their journey: from exploration, moving to sponsorship to first-year apprentices, second-year apprentices. Mentees are also turning to mentors. They also support each other."
– Stream 2 interviewee
Lessons learned
Funding recipients have identified lessons learned and best practices while operating their projects.
The 2019 and 2020 Federal Apprenticeship Programs Survey also collected more information on the funding recipients' experiences during the implementation of their projects:
an inclusive learning environment promotes diversity, equity and encourages participation
To ensure an inclusive environment, particularly for newcomers and persons with disabilities, many funding recipients raised the need for:
inclusive language
wording and strategies in recruitment
by-laws and other internal policy documents
the establishment of good relationships and partnerships with local agencies should be encouraged
these partnerships helped in promoting programs, recruiting and training new apprentices, journeypersons and targeted key groups
mentorship is crucial in recruiting key group participants
several funding recipients have utilized existing and past trainees as mentors to advertise trainings through testimonials and encourage program participation
provision of accurate information increased awareness of the various programs
almost 30% of funding recipients reported that the provision of accurate information regarding available:
trainings
career choices and opportunities through job activities and information sessions
have increased awareness of the various programs
Section 3: Performance measurement
These findings addressed the following evaluation question:
to what extent do performance measurement and reporting tools and mechanisms support the program in monitoring and measuring the program's contribution in improving labour market outcomes for funding participants in the Red Seal trades?
There was a lack of project accountability information that made performance measurement reporting difficult.
Framework
The Program has a performance measurement framework, which includes:
a logic model (see Annex D)
indicators
such as:
the number of individuals participating in the projects
data collection tools
to support reporting on results and available through the Common System for Grants and Contributions:
quarterly reports: activity and, data
close out reports when applicable
to fulfill their reporting requirements stated in the contribution agreements, the funding recipients are
required to submit key performance indicator annual reports and quarterly reports. These reports demonstrate the achievement of expected results
Reporting
The project files review conducted in 2021 assessed projects that had been ongoing for more than 1 year
The review revealed that
no performance indicator files was uploaded in the Common System for Grants and Contributions
Since the inception of the Program, 1 project was completed and submitted a final report in 2019 and 2020. Also, 25 funded projects ended in 2020 and 2021 but were not covered by this evaluation. Final reports on performance indicators are required from funding recipients 6 months after the end of their project
The Federal Apprenticeship Programs Survey
Since 2019, the Trades and Apprenticeship Division at Skills and Employment Branch and Programs Operation Branch have worked together to collect data through the Federal Apprenticeship Programs Survey
The Federal Apprenticeship Programs Survey was conducted to gather annual data on the Key Performance Indicators (KPI), as set in the Treasury Board submission. Also, the survey aims to identify lessons learned and best practices in order to obtain data to better support policy, program development and decision-making. In 2019 and 2020, questions about the challenges of COVID-19 were also added to the survey
According to the 2019 and 2020 Federal Apprenticeship Programs Survey report, some of the funding recipients reported they did not collect or report on key groups' employment in their projects. Therefore complete and accurate information on key groups could not be available. This may be due to funding recipient's lack of understanding around their responsibilities and authorities to collect this information (which is provided, voluntarily, by project participants). Additionally, these results could be underreported, as recipients also reported that some participants – notably Indigenous Peoples – are hesitant to declare their status
Additionally, because some Stream 1 projects are below a certain funding amount, they are given as grants rather than a contribution agreement. Some funding recipients of grants have not reported on their annual Key Performance Indicators for this reason as they feel less obliged to. It is however, still a requirement of the Program
Finally, because all funding recipients didn't participate in this survey, it was not possible to provide a comprehensive picture of the Program results
Section 4: Other findings
Gender-based analysis plus
Responding to the under-representation of women, the Program aims to increase the number and quality of training opportunities for women
Priority has been given to projects that demonstrate benefits for people who face additional barriers to the trades, including women
Gender-based analysis plus of the impacts of the Program has been planned to be monitored through participation data collected from funding recipients
Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic
According to the 2019 and 2020 Federal Apprenticeship Programs Survey results,
the COVID-19 pandemic has become one of the greatest challenges that have affected the operations of almost all existing projects
:
more than two thirds
of funding recipients record that the pandemic has negatively impacted the
procurement of equipment, shipments, travel and training:
example 1:
Stream 1—Construction and General Workers Training Trust Fund of Alberta and NWT project cancelled programs due to COVID-19
example 2:
Stream 2— The Labourers' Training Institute of NB had to run a very small class cohort as a result of COVID-19. In fact, participants back out the day the apprenticeship was supposed to start
Mitigation strategies
Although the COVID-19 pandemic has challenged funding recipients during their projects' implementation, they have developed strategies to still achieve their goals. The 2019 and 2020 Federal Apprenticeship Programs Survey reveals that:
some funding recipients adopted coping mechanisms to continue their operations.
example:
Mohawk College of Applied Arts & Technology migrated classes to virtual delivery
the projects that could operate during COVID increased scope by eliminating geographical barriers and creating access across Canada.
Also, the Department encouraged various strategies to help funding recipients meet the Program's goals:
the Stream 1 2020 calls for proposal prioritized online and/or virtual equipment purchases while Stream 2 gave projects that provide online and virtual training greater consideration
The program guidelines were
more flexible
.
For example:
delays or postponement of project activities were allowed to readjust project activities – for example:
move from in person/in-class to virtual training
adjustment of project costs and additional costs were also allowed – for example:
virtual training set-up
Personal Protection Equipment (PPE)
at-home set-up for employees
additional time was granted to projects due to reduce number of participant/intake, and due to halt of certain activities
more time was also granted to submit reports such as claims and activity reports, usually due within 30 days
Section 5: Conclusion and recommendations
Conclusions
Overall, the Union Training and Innovative Program was designed and implemented as intended. Employment and Social Development Canada now have a mechanism to work with unions to address apprenticeship challenges
The support for union-based apprenticeship training through the Program has been helpful, especially under Stream 1. In fact, keeping up with advances in technology for training equipment can be expensive
Generally, funding recipients were satisfied with the services provided by Employment and Social Development Canada
The Program has helped funding recipients in fostering innovation in the delivery of its 2 streams. The Program has also contributed in improving the participation of key groups in trades training and careers
In addition, the Union Training and Innovative Program has made progress in meeting many of its outcomes. The Program has increased access to new training equipment and materials, and training opportunities; its projects have helped participants continue their training and apprenticeships
Finally, there is room for improvement for the Program's performance monitoring; specifically, in data collection and performance records
Recommendations
Improve the Program's performance monitoring, data collection and performance records
Explore how other apprenticeship trainings could target regions where union involvement in training is less prevalent
Section 6: Annexes
Annex A: Recommendations of the evaluation
Findings and information that support the recommendations
The Federal Apprenticeship Programs Survey was conducted to gather annual data on the Key Performance Indicators (KPI), as set in the Treasury Board submission. Also, the survey aims to identify lessons learned and best practices in order to obtain data to better support policy, program development and decision-making
To fulfill their reporting requirements stated in the contribution agreements, the funding recipients are required to submit key performance indicator annual reports and quarterly reports, which demonstrate the achievement of expected results:
the project files review conducted in 2021 assessed projects that had been ongoing for more than 1 year
the review revealed that even though the Key Performance Indicators were collected through the annual Federal Apprenticeship Program Survey, no performance indicator files was uploaded in the Common System for Grants and Contributions
since the inception of the Program, only 1 project was completed and submitted a final report
Recommendation
Improve the Program's performance monitoring, data collection and performance records
Findings and information that support the recommendations
The 2019 and 2020 Federal Apprenticeship Programs Survey report reveals that Ontario had the largest number of funded projects (38) followed by British Columbia with 11 projects
The regional distribution of projects is consistent with the fact that for both Stream 1 and Stream 2, Ontario has had the largest number of union training centres. This is consistent with the distribution of registered /continuing apprentices across Canada as shown in the 2019 Registered Apprenticeship Information System
Other provinces and territories where training is almost universally provided through public institutions have relatively few union training centres and have benefited less from the Program funding (such as Alberta, Manitoba)
Recommendation
Explore how other apprenticeship trainings could target regions where union involvement in training is less prevalent

Lines of evidence
Key Informant Interviews
Conducted with 12 Program officials, as well as 30 funding recipients (21 from the Stream 1 and 9 from the Stream 2)
Document Review
Consisted of an analysis of the information contained in grants and contributions agreements for the organizations that were funded, and internal documents
Federal Apprenticeship Program Survey
Consisted of the 2019 and 2020 Federal Apprenticeship Programs Survey
Annex F: Scale for reporting
The following "scale" was used in the key informant interviews to help indicate the significance of respondent comments by respondent type. These percentages correspond to the relative weight of responses from key informants who held similar views.
The following provides a useful summary to help gauge the significance of the qualitative findings in terms of the relative proportion of responses:
"All"—
findings reflect the views and opinions of 100% of the key informants in the group
"Almost all"—
findings reflect the views and opinions of at least 90% but less than 100% of key informants in the group
"Large majority/most"—
findings reflect the views and opinions of at least 75% but less than 90% of key informants in the group
"Majority"—
findings reflect the views and opinions of at least 51% but less than 75% of key informants in the group
"Some"—
findings reflect the views and opinions of at least 25% but less than 51% of key informants in the group
"A few"—
findings reflect the views and opinions of at least 2 respondents but less than 25% of key informants in the group
Annex G: Evaluation limitations and challenges
Challenges related to the Key Informant Interviews:
the contact information of the funding recipients were not available. The information eventually was extracted from the Common System of Grants and Contributions system. However, some of those contact information were not up to date. Therefore, the evaluator could not reach out to some of the funding recipients
generally, participation of funding recipients, for both streams, was easier relative to that of the program areas. Besides, interviewees from Programs Operations Branch were new and could not inform the evaluation.
since the interview questions were designed before the document and literature review, the interview questions did not help in gathering information about assessment of proposals, some of the expected activities, output and outcomes of the program
one of the interview questions aimed to gather information on assessment criteria. However, we could not gather information on assessment criteria due to lack of information from participants
another question aimed to gather information about the current situation of key Performance Indicator documents that funding recipients supposed to submit annually. However, we could not gather information on assessment criteria due to lack of information from participants
the funding recipient interviewees did not know well about their projects' streams. In other words, the Stream number or name did not mean that much to them. In addition, in many cases, they have received funding from both streams. Therefore, the interviewer had to guide them during the interview to ensure that the interviewee responded to the questions for the Stream they were invited for
insufficient number of Program officials interviewed had sufficient knowledge of the funded projects and the surrounding processes covered during the evaluation period (for example intake procedures, or performance measurement strategies). This is likely due to staff turnover within the Program
Challenges related to the 2019 and 2020 Federal Apprenticeship Programs Survey:
the 2019 and 2020 Federal Apprenticeship Programs survey report confirms that some of the funding recipients have not been keeping data particularly on key groups and therefore could not provide complete accurate information on key groups. This is due in part to a misunderstanding of their roles and responsibilities in collecting data on key groups, and hesitancy from key groups in disclosing their heritage or background.
the survey was administered from August 2020 to October 2020, and covered the results for active projects in the 2019 and 2020 fiscal year. Out of 147 funding recipients 122 provided responses to the survey, representing a response rate of 83%. It includes:
104 projects for Stream 1 (out of 128 total funded projects for this stream)
and 18 projects for Stream 2 (out of 19 total funded projects for this stream)
however, the response rate was 81% (n=104) for Stream 1 and 95% (n=18) for Stream 2.
Challenges related to the limited reporting information available:
the evaluation team could not find the annual key performance indicator files in Common System for Grants and Contributions even though all assessed projects had been ongoing for more than 1 year
Annex H: Annual key performance indicators
In order to monitor progress achieved against the projects' expected results, funding recipients were required to report annually on key performance indicators throughout their projects' lifecycle. The indicators are provided in the Performance Information Profile of the Union Training and Innovation Program. They are as follows*:
number of individuals participating in the funded projects
number of individuals participating in the funded projects that are part of a key group (women, Indigenous Peoples, newcomers, and persons with disabilities)
number and type of partners (for example, union, employers)
percentage increase in investment by partners in training (from the year prior to the project)
percentage of individuals participating in funded projects reporting an increase in skills after program intervention
percentage of women, Indigenous Peoples, newcomers, and persons with a disability participating in funded projects continuing in apprenticeship training (or obtaining certification)
percentage of individuals participating in funded projects progressing to the next level (for example, apprentices to the next level of apprenticeship or to certification)
percentage of individuals participating in funded projects who are employed in a skilled trade
*An estimation of these numbers should be included in the project proposals by funding applicants even before the starts of the projects. During the projects, Employment and Social Development Canada expects the actual numbers to be sent to Employment and Social
