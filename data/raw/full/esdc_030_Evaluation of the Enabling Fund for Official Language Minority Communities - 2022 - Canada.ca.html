<p>With the support of the Enabling Fund, recipients undertook a variety of activities that contributed to enhancing their capacity in the areas of human resources and economic development.  Recipients demonstrated their capacity to build partnerships and leverage resources for concerted action that have positive impacts on Canada’s official language minority communities.</p>
<p>In the spirit of continuous improvement and ESDC’s effort to strengthen reporting and limit administrative burden on recipients, the Evaluation recommended that the Department explore approaches to improve the Program’s ability to consistently capture results.</p></section>
<section>
<h3 id="h2-2-2">Recommendation #1</h3>
<p>The program is encouraged to explore approaches to improve the program’s ability to consistently capture results from funded projects.</p></section>
<section>
<h3 id="h2-2-3">Response </h3>
<p>ESDC agrees with the evaluation’s recommendation and recognizes the importance of being able to effectively measure the results of funded projects and demonstrate how they contribute to meeting the program’s objectives. </p>
<p>ESDC will work collaboratively with partners to explore approaches to enable both the Program and its funding recipients to clearly define success and capture the necessary results to demonstrate impact. </p>
<p>This would include examining improvements to the program’s performance measurement framework and its implementation such as: </p>
<ul>
<li>how the department defines and communicates success and desired results</li>
<li>what frameworks or tools can be used to support demonstration of results </li>
<li>how to better leverage data to inform Program objectives and departmental processes, and</li>
<li>the sufficiency and clarity of reporting requirements</li></ul>
<p>ESDC is already addressing aspects of the evaluation recommendation through close collaboration with the Program’s funding recipients to revise and clarify the Annual Results Reports template to improve consistency of reporting.  </p>
<p>In the context of the forthcoming modernization of the <em>Official Languages Act</em> and the development of a new Action Plan for Official Languages, the upcoming Call for Proposals for the Enabling Fund presents a valuable opportunity to begin to advance improvements and develop the necessary frameworks and tools to build capacity within recipient organizations. </p></section>
<section>
<h3 id="h2-2-4">Management action plan</h3>
<p>The Skills and Employment Branch, with the support from the heads of performance measurement and evaluation will explore methods to enhance the Program’s performance management framework, including performance indicators, and the associated Performance Information Profile. To be completed by March 2023.</p>

<h3 id="h2-4-3">Program activities</h3>
<p>Official language minority communities across Canada have different characteristics, needs and priorities. Accordingly, each recipient organization undertakes different activities, while still responding directly to the overarching objectives of the Enabling Fund. Each contribution agreement signatory leads, coordinates and supports capacity building in the areas of community economic development and human resources development. </p>
<p>These activities can be divided into 3 main areas.</p>
<h4>Building partnerships and leveraging additional resources</h4>
<p>The ability to convene stakeholders, build partnerships and leverage additional resources from partners is key to contribution agreement signatories’ enabling and capacity building role. To this end, they collaborate with a range of community stakeholders, the private sector, non-profit funders, and different levels of government. These efforts represent a core area of activity of the funded organizations.</p>
<h4>Community economic development activities</h4>
<p>Contribution agreement signatories also carry out various activities in support of community economic development. </p>
<p>Examples of eligible activities:</p>
<ul>
<li>leading processes to encourage community participation in community consultations and economic development planning</li>
<li>developing and implementing local economic development initiatives to:
<ul>
<li>promote businesses (for example, business-planning services, trade missions, supporting the development of supply-chains)</li>
<li>promote the communities as tourist destinations</li>
<li>implement revenue-generating events (for example, tourism products)</li>
<li>attract immigrants and integrate them into the minority communities</li></ul></li>
<li>assisting employers in meeting their skill needs (for example, job fairs, and job matching services)</li>
<li>developing workforce attraction and retention strategies</li>
<li>raising awareness about entrepreneurship</li></ul>
<h4>Human resources development activities</h4>
<p>Lastly, contribution agreement signatories carry out various activities to support jobseekers, workers, entrepreneurs, and employers. </p>
<p>Examples of eligible activities:</p>
<ul>
<li>developing learning tools</li>
<li>facilitating learning events (for example, workshops, training sessions and camps)</li>
<li>providing business-networking opportunities</li>
<li>providing guidance and support to jobseekers</li>
<li>providing mentoring to jobseekers, workers, and small business owners</li></ul>

<h2>Evaluation approach and methodology</h2>
<section>
<h3 id="h2-5-1">Purpose of the evaluation</h3>
<p>In accordance with the <em>Financial Administration Act</em> and the Policy on Results requirements, the Enabling Fund must be evaluated every 5 years. The program must therefore be evaluated by March 31, 2022.</p>
<p>Evaluation objectives:</p>
<ul>
<li>confirm whether the objectives and activities carried out by the contribution agreement signatories continue to be aligned with program objectives and eligible activities</li>
<li>determine to what extent planned activities were implemented </li>
<li>assess whether these contribute to enhancing the development and vitality of official language minority communities and identify examples of such contributions</li>
<li>gain insight about the pandemic’s impact on contribution agreement signatories to inform the description of the current program context</li></ul>
</section>
<section>
<h3 id="h2-5-2">Evaluation lines of evidence and questions</h3>
<p>The evaluation scope, questions and lines of evidence were developed in consultation with Strategic Integration and Corporate Affairs and the Program Operations Branch. </p>
<p>This evaluation is of a limited scope. The following was taken into account when setting the scope of the evaluation:</p>
<ul>
<li>the program maturity</li>
<li>the stable nature of program activities carried out by contribution agreement signatories</li>
<li>the positive results of previous program evaluations</li>
<li>the quality of data collection and reporting instruments</li></ul>
<p>Data collection for this evaluation took place during the COVID-19 pandemic and captured contextual insights about how organizations were adapting to the pandemic. However, assessing the impact of the pandemic on funded organizations and their activities was not part of the scope of the evaluation. Accordingly, the evaluation timeframe is set from April 2018 to March 2020 in order to exclude the impact of the pandemic from observed results. The Enabling Fund investment during this timeframe was $31.5 million.</p>
<h4>Lines of evidence</h4>
<p>Five of the 14 contribution agreement signatory organizations were selected to provide data as part of this evaluation:</p>
<ul>
<li><span lang="fr">Association Franco-Yukonnaise</span></li>
<li><span lang="fr">Conseil de développement économique de l’Alberta</span></li>
<li>Community Economic Development and Employability Corporation (Québec)</li>
<li><span lang="fr">Conseil économique du Nouveau Brunswick</span></li>
<li><span lang="fr">Société économique de l’Ontario</span></li></ul>
<p>Contribution agreement signatories in the Yukon, Alberta, and New Brunswick were randomly selected among northern, western, and eastern organizations to ensure regional representation. The organization in Ontario was selected given the size of the Francophone community that it serves.  The organization in Québec was selected because it is the only one serving Anglophones in Canada. </p>
<p>The evaluation is based on 2 main lines of evidence:</p>
<ul>
<li>key informant interviews with 17 leaders and staff members of the 5 organizations</li>
<li>a review of 80 documents provided by 5 organizations between April 2018 and March 2020, which included:
<ul>
<li>65 quarterly activity reports (13 per organization) covering fiscal years 2018 to 2019 and 2019 to 2020</li>
<li>10 contribution agreements (2 per organization), 5 covering the fiscal years 2014 to 2018, and 5 covering the years 2019 to 2023 </li>
<li>5 annual reports (1 per organization) covering the fiscal year 2019 to 2020</li></ul></li></ul>
<p>Results reported in quarterly activity reports were classified in relation to the objectives and planned activities outlined in contribution agreements. Results reported for 2018 to 2019 were classified in relation to 2014 to 2018 contribution agreements. Results reported for 2019 to 2020 were classified in relation to 2019 to 2023 contribution agreements. </p>
<p>As part of this document review, detailed matrices were produced summarizing all the reported results for 2018 to 2019 and 2019 to 2020. Results reported for 2019 to 2020 were also compared with information provided in the 2019 to 2020 annual reports. </p>
<p>Document review results were then compared to the answer provided by the leaders and staff of the 5 organisations included in the evaluation.</p>
<h4>Evaluation questions</h4>
<p>The evaluation addressed 3 main questions and 1 sub-question: </p>
<ul>
<li>Do objectives and activities carried out by contribution agreement signatories 2018 to 2019 and 2019 to 2020 continue to be aligned with the Enabling Fund objectives and eligible activities?</li>
<li>Do reported results demonstrate the extent to which contribution agreement signatories implemented the planned activities?</li>
<li>Do implemented activities and reported results contribute to enhancing the development and vitality of official language minority communities? 
<ul>
<li>What examples can be provided by selected Contribution Agreement Signatories?</li></ul></li></ul>
<p><a href="#h2-appc">Appendix C</a> provides a summary of which lines of evidence inform each evaluation question.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3 id="h2-5-3">Evaluation limitations </h3>
<p>The evaluation faced challenges with singling out outputs and attributing outcomes to the Enabling Fund. This stems, in part, from the enabling nature of the program and the context in which contribution agreement signatories operate.</p>
<p>Five factors that impede the singling out of outputs and attribution of outcomes to the program were identified.</p>
<p>First, the staff employed through the core funding provided by the Enabling Fund secure significant additional funding from other sources. They use these funds to develop and implement activities, programs, and initiatives. Leveraged funding can be claimed as a program outcome. However, the outcomes associated with the activities, programs, and initiatives funded through leveraged resources cannot be attributed directly to the Enabling Fund investment. </p>
<p>Second, building partnerships, and enabling other organizations and stakeholders to develop and implement initiatives is a core area of activity of funded organizations. While signatories may provide leadership, support, and coordination for these initiatives, the outcomes of these initiatives cannot be attributed solely to the Enabling Fund. </p>
<p>Third, funding is allocated through contribution agreements to 14 non-profit organizations. These organizations use the funding to enable community economic and human resource development in official language minority communities across Canada. Each community has different levels of economic, human, and social capital resources on which funded organisations can draw. Accordingly, contribution agreement signatories operate in very different contexts and cannot be treated as equals or compared with each other. This impedes comparative output and outcome evaluation. </p>
<p>Fourth, for most program activities, the collection of reliable data on end users would, in practice, be very difficult. This hinders participant outcome analysis.</p>
<p>Finally, the difficulty of identifying valid counterfactuals combined with the influence of external factors further impedes outcome attribution. Examples of significant external factors include major structural or cyclical shifts in the economy and the changing demographic make-up of communities.</p>
<p>Due to these limitations, the evaluation is not designed to draw definitive conclusions about the program’s impact. Rather, it aims to provide insight into the contributions that funded organizations make to the development and vitality of the communities they serve.</p></section>

<section id="h2-6">
<h2>Evaluation findings</h2>
<section>
<h3 id="h2-6-1">Context, challenges, and opportunities faced by contribution agreement signatories</h3>
<h4>Context </h4>
<p>The context in which contribution agreement signatories operate varies significantly across provinces and territories. </p>
<ul>
<li>Some operate in jurisdictions that are officially bilingual and have large, well-established populations, while others serve much smaller populations in largely unilingual jurisdictions</li>
<li>In some provinces/territories, contribution agreement signatories can collaborate with a greater variety of existing institutions and organizations, while in others options are more limited</li>
<li>In some provincial/territorial jurisdictions, organizations serve many geographically dispersed official language minority communities, each of which has their distinct characteristics and economic contexts</li> </ul>
<p>Community specific contexts and characteristics influence the opportunities available to them, as well as the types of activities planned by funded organizations.</p>
<p>For example, in jurisdictions where bilingual labour is in demand, organizations may focus their efforts on the recruitment and placement of qualified immigrant workers. In so doing, they support the workforce needs of employers and contribute to the maintenance or growth of official language minority populations.</p>
<p>Alternately, in jurisdictions with relatively few bilingual job opportunities, organizations may focus on pre-employment training and employment assistance services for community members. Helping community members to integrate into the majority language workplace reduces the risk that they will leave the region to find work. In so doing, the organizations help to mitigate population decline in official language minority communities.</p></section>
<section>
<h3 id="h2-6-2">Challenges and opportunities</h3>
<h4>Staff turnover</h4>
<p>Key informants were asked about the challenges faced by their organization. Overall, they reported few issues, but staff turnover was mentioned by 3 of the 5 organizations included in the evaluation. These organizations attributed staff turnover to:</p>
<ul>
<li>competition for qualified Francophone workers, and </li>
<li>an inability to provide competitive salaries compared to private and public sector employers</li> </ul>
<p>According to key informants, staff turnover destabilises the organization until the vacated position is filled and drains the organizations of acquired knowledge and skills.</p>
<h4>Other challenges</h4>
<ul>
<li>Making program and services available and accessible to all official language minority communities in larger provinces and territories</li>
<li>Being visible and known by community members and stakeholders throughout the province/territory </li>
<li>Being visible in service environments that include much larger Anglophone organizations, with significant marketing budgets</li> </ul>
<h4>The COVID-19 pandemic</h4>
<p>The <span lang="fr">Réseau de développement économique et d’employabilité</span> Canada is the national level Enabling Fund contribution agreement signatory. The organization commissioned a report on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the organizations and their activities across Canada. </p>
<p>The report found that organizations experienced initial challenges in moving their services online. Organizations also reported ongoing challenges delivering some types of programs and services while social distancing protocols are in effect. Finally, organizations explained that online programs and services are not accessible for individuals who do not have access to high-speed internet and computers.</p>
<p>The report also found that the move to online program and service delivery came to be perceived as an opportunity by most funded organizations. Activities that required time-consuming and costly travel before the pandemic are now being offered online. </p>
<p>Because of this change, programs and services are reaching members of official language minority communities in previously unserved rural and remote locations. Some organisations also see opportunities for collaboration between contribution agreement signatories to serve official language minority communities across provincial and territorial jurisdictions.</p>
</section>

<h3 id="h2-6-4">Implementation of planned activities</h3>
<h4>Key Findings</h4>
<ul>
<li>The 5 organizations implemented planned activities from April 2018 to March 2019</li>
<li>Organizations took advantage of emerging opportunities to develop and implement additional activities</li>
<li>A few planned activities were cancelled in response to changing context</li></ul>
<h4>Implemented activities</h4>
<p>The 5 organizations implemented planned activities from April 2018 to March 2019. Organisations adapted their activities to changing context. Changes in partner priorities, economic context, and funding availability, as well as lessons learned led contribution agreement signatories to adjust their planned activities. This process is encouraged and facilitated by ESDC, as it increases the organizations’ ability to achieve targeted project outcomes. </p>
<p>In their contribution agreements, each signatory organization identifies a list of their objectives, related planned activities and expected results. In their quarterly activity reports and annual reports, the organizations report on their progress toward implementing their planned activities and reaching their expected results. This data was used to assess the extent to which the 5 organizations implemented their planned activities. The accuracy of the data on implemented activities and populations served was confirmed through key informant interviews. </p>
<p>A detailed review of the 5 organizations’ documents revealed significant variation in contribution agreement structures and reporting style between organizations, and between fiscal years.<sup id="fn3-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn3"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>3</a></sup>  Some of the contribution agreements and reporting styles lend themselves more readily to facilitating an assessment of achieved results. Specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>some contribution agreements had clearly aligned project objectives, planned activities, and expected results, while others were less well aligned</li>
<li>some contribution agreements had clear and measureable targets, while others less tangible output targets, or targets that would be very difficult to measure</li>
<li>some quarterly activity reports were written in a way that clearly linked project objectives, implemented activities, and achieved results, while others were less structured</li>
<li>one organization demarcated itself in its ability to capture some of their activities’ contributions to intermediate outcomes</li></ul>
<p>The content and organization of information provided in quarterly reports reflect the project objectives, planned activities, and expected results outlined in contribution agreements. Organizations with clearly articulated and well-aligned objectives, activities, and results submitted quarterly reports that more consistently captured results.</p>
<p>Despite the variation in the documents reviewed, the information was detailed enough to determined that most planned activities were implemented. Overall, the document revue revealed that the 5 organizations:</p>
<ul>
<li>made reasonable efforts to implement their planned activities</li>
<li>adapted to changing opportunity structures and tried to take advantage of emerging opportunities</li>
<li>adjusted their planned activities based on lessons learned</li></ul>
<p>The specific activities implemented by the organizations and their associated results are too numerous to present in this report. Examples of each organization’s activities and results are provided to illustrate the breadth of implemented activities the extent of the results achieved.</p>

<h4>Targeted subpopulations</h4>
<p>All organisations developed programs and services designed to meet the specific needs of 1 or more Official Language Minority Community subpopulation. </p>
<ul>
<li>Programs and services designed for immigrants were delivered in all of the organizations</li>
<li>Programs and services designed for women and youth were delivered in 4 organisations</li>
<li>2 or fewer organisations delivered programs and services designed for Black youth, Black immigrants, Indigenous people, seniors, and visible minorities</li></ul>
<p>The distinct program needs of these subpopulations were identified through community consultations, planning exercises, research, surveys, and regular interaction with community members and stakeholders.</p>
<p>The organizations reported working in collaboration with a variety of organisations to identify needs, develop relevant programming, recruit participants and deliver services. Examples of services delivered include the following:</p>
<ul>

<h4>Early childhood education initiative</h4>
<p>The 2018 to 2023 Action Plan for Official Languages allocated an investment of $20 million in early childhood education and childcare. From that investment, the Enabling Fund received $6.85 million to foster the development of start-up capacities of early childhood educators. The initiative aims to increase the number of Francophone childcare spaces in Francophone minority communities. </p>
<p>The <span lang="fr">Réseau de développement économique et d’employabilité</span> Canada was selected to implement the initiative and to redistribute funds to selected stakeholders. These stakeholders implement and deliver approved projects. </p>
<p>In the first stage of funding, the <span lang="fr">Réseau de développement économique et d’employabilité</span> Canada conducted research to:</p>
<ul>
<li>identify community needs</li>
<li>prioritize areas for improvement, and </li>
<li>develop a funding plan</li></ul>
<p>The organization then signed 12 sub-agreements with service providers to support community projects.</p>
<p>Each of the 4 Francophone organizations included in this evaluation had implemented activities in support of this broader initiative in 2019 to 2020.<sup id="fn4-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn4"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>4</a></sup>  Examples of supportive activities included the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>undertaking market and feasibility studies</li>
<li>supporting the funding proposals submitted by service providers in their jurisdiction</li>

<h3 id="h2-6-5">Contribution to enhancing the development and vitality of communities</h3>
<h4>Key Findings </h4>
<p>The evidence summarized in this section and documented in Appendix D demonstrates that activities carried out by the 5 selected organizations:</p>
<ul>
<li>build partnerships </li>
<li>leverage additional resources </li>
<li>contribute to enhancing community economic development and human resources development of official language minority communities</li></ul>
<p>Each organization collaborated with a broad variety of partners, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>chambers of commerce</li>
<li>local economic development organizations</li>
<li>municipal, provincial, and federal governments</li>
<li>non-profit organizations</li>
<li>primary, secondary, and postsecondary education institutions</li>
<li>private sector businesses and employers</li></ul>
<p>All organizations worked in collaboration with majority language organizations, as well as other Official Language Minority Community organizations.</p>
<p>As demonstrated in Table 2, each organization was successful in leveraging additional funds in fiscal years 2018 to 2019 and 2019 to 2020. Given the very different provincial and territorial contexts in which they operate, the amount of funding leveraged by each organization is not comparable. The amount of leveraged funding varied from one year to the next depending on the types of activities that were being implemented. </p>

<p>Implemented activities and reported results demonstrate that the contribution agreement signatories have delivered on expected outputs as outlined in the Enabling Fund logic model.<sup id="fn7-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn7"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>7</a></sup>  As illustrated in the logic model, outputs can reasonably contribute to increased human resources and community economic development capacity of official language minority communities.</p>
<p>The examples provided illustrate how the activities of the funded organizations contribute to the development and vitality of official language minority communities.</p>
<h4>Examples of <span lang="fr">Association Franco-Yukonnaise</span> contributions to program outcomes</h4>
<h5>Francophone immigration forum in Whitehorse </h5>
<p>They organised and coordinated the forum, which brought together the main local and territorial stakeholders involved in the settlement and integration of Francophone immigrants. The forum identified the activities and services that were included in the Francophone Welcoming Initiative’s action plan for Whitehorse.</p>
<h5>Networking event in collaboration with the Whitehorse Chamber of Commerce </h5>
<p>Over 85 people participated in the event. Participants included business owners, municipal, territorial and federal public servants, municipal councillors, territorial government ministers, the mayor of Whitehorse, and other community members. The event helped to increase awareness about the organization and the Francophone community. It also allowed Francophone business people, entrepreneurs, and service providers to network and gain more visibility in the community.</p>
<h4>Examples of <span lang="fr">Conseil de développement économique de l’Alberta</span> contributions to program outcomes </h4>
<h5>Old School Cheesery <span lang="fr">Économusée</span></h5>
<p>They facilitated the process of opening the first <span lang="fr">Économusée</span> in Alberta. The designation as an <span lang="fr">Économusée</span> brings visibility to the business. It also represents a new cultural tourism attraction and encourages tourism to the community of Vermilion, Alberta.</p>
<h5>Entrepreneurial workshop for Francophone immigrant women</h5>
<p>They collaborated with Francophonie <span lang="fr">Albertaine Plurielle</span> to design and deliver a workshop for Francophone immigrant women who wish to launch a small business in Alberta. The workshop attracted approximately 50 participants. Many subsequently contacted the <span lang="fr">Conseil de développement économique de l’Alberta</span> to receive start-up support services to launch a business. It also led to the creation of the <span lang="fr">Elles des Affaires</span>, a women’s business group that offers professional development and networking opportunities. </p>
<h4>Examples of Community Economic Development and Employability Corporation contributions to program outcomes </h4>
<h5>Earn while you learn program</h5>
<p>They developed and delivered a program that combined workplace-specific French as a second language training with job specific training. Participants in the 300-hour training program received a salary during the course and then worked for a local employer. They were hired to fill a variety of entry-level positions such as cashiers, cleaning staff, and assistant cooks. </p>
<p>In 2019 to 2020, 11 people participated in the program, 8 of whom were hired by the employer. Two participants reported that their families were able to stay in the region because they found work. In addition to the impact on participants, the program helped to address a labour shortage affecting one of the main employers in the community. </p>
<h5>Integrated Learning Model </h5>
<p>The organization piloted an integrated learning model in 2 communities. The training was developed in collaboration with the communities, local employers and other stakeholders. It sought to address the literacy, language, soft-skills, and job specific skills needed by participants to meet the workforce needs of local employers. </p>
<p>In 2018 to 2019, 17 students participated in the program pilot. Of those, 11 completed the training and 5 (29%) obtained employment. These results compare favourably to the 13% average for other adult education programs in the 2 communities. A detailed program evaluation was completed to assess outcomes and to refine the program.</p>
<h4>Examples of <span lang="fr">Conseil économique du Nouveau Brunswick contributions to program outcomes</span> </h4>
<h5><span lang="fr">Mode d’emploi</span> program</h5>
<p>They designed and delivered a 6-week pre-employment and employment assistance program for Francophone visible minority women. The program includes visits to employers and networking opportunities. </p>
<p>By March 2020, 3 cohorts had participated in the program. Following the training, half of the participants found work in their field. Some were hired by employers they had met through the program.</p>
<h5>Innovating through improved processes program</h5>
<p>The program covers up to $50,000 worth of business consulting services. It aims to improve participating businesses’ performance and competitiveness through lean manufacturing and improved business processes. </p>
<p>By March 2020, 15 businesses had participated in the program. The organization reported that the program was very well received by participants and had led to concrete results. 1 business saved $500,000 and another doubled its revenues thanks to changes made following their participation. </p>
<h4>Examples of <span lang="fr">Société économique de l’Ontario</span> contributions to program outcomes </h4>
<h5>Structured mentorship program for highly skilled immigrants </h5>
<p>The program simultaneously addresses employers labour force needs and helps newcomers to obtain their first paid work experience in their field. It matches employers with highly skilled immigrant workers to fill open positions. The program is offered throughout Canada in collaboration with:</p>
<ul>
<li>the <span lang="fr">Réseau de développement économique et d’employabilité du Canada</span></li>
<li>the <span lang="fr">Conseil de développement économique des municipalités bilingues du Manitoba</span></li>
<li>the <span lang="fr">Société de développement économique de la Colombie-Britannique</span></li></ul>
<p>Being in demand from both employers and participants, the program has served over 3 times more participants than its annual target of 10 participants. Most participants remained employed post-participation. </p>
<h5>Business Incubator program</h5>
<p>They designed and launched an online business incubator program that serves Francophones throughout the province. Over the course of the program, participants complete the preparatory work necessary to be ready to launch their business. For example, they receive training, support from GrowthWheel certified experts, and networking opportunities. The program is in high demand.</p>

<h2>Conclusion and recommendation</h2>
<p>The findings presented in this evaluation report confirm that the 5 organisations are implementing relevant activities that contribute to the Enabling Fund program objectives.</p>
<ul>
<li>The objectives and activities carried out by the contribution agreement signatories continue to be aligned with program objectives and eligible activities</li>
<li>The organisations implement most of the activities outlined in their contribution agreements</li>
<li>The activities carried out by the organizations:
<ul>
<li>build partnerships</li>
<li>leverage additional resources</li>
<li>contribute to enhancing the community economic development of official language minority communities</li>
<li>contribute to the growth and development of human resources in official language minority communities</li></ul></li></ul>
<p>The evaluation also found that the organisations adapt to changing contexts, including the COVID-19 pandemic. All organizations were able to adapt the majority of their programs and services to be delivered online. The pandemic made it more difficult to provide some types of programs and services. However, it also enabled organisations to reach more community members in rural and remote regions of their jurisdiction. </p>

<summary id="figa-1">Figure A 1 – Text version</summary>
<p>Visual representation of the Enabling Fund’s logic model. It presents the relationship between inputs, activities, outputs, immediate outcomes, intermediate outcomes and ultimate outcomes.</p>
<p>External factors and programs, from other government departments, other levels of government and other stakeholders have an impact on program outcomes. The influence of external factors increases progressively from the inputs to ultimate outcomes. Accordingly, while outputs can be said to lead to immediate outcomes, immediate outcomes can only be said to contribute to intermediate outcomes. </p>
<p>
In other words, it presents how:</p>
<ol>
<li>inputs, consisting of funding and full-time employee equivalents, are used to deliver activities, which include:  
<ul>
<li>contribution agreement negotiation, reporting and accountability, stakeholder engagement, and tools development</li>
<li>recipient organizations lead, coordinate and/or support capacity building in the areas of community economic development and human resource development in official language minority communities</li></ul></li>
<li>activities yield outputs, such as the following:
<ul>
<li>reports, policy and operational guidelines</li>
<li>products, such as plans, reports, tools and guides</li>
<li>engagements, such as committees, meetings, networking events and surveys</li>
<li>services, such as services to businesses, entrepreneurs, not-for-profit organizations, and services to jobseekers</li></ul></li>
<li>outputs lead to immediate outcomes:
<ul>
<li>official language minority communities members have the knowledge, tools, and supports to help realize their economic potential</li>
<li>partnerships are established to support community economic and human resource development in official language minority communities</li></ul></li>
<li>immediate outcomes contribute to the intermediate outcome:
<ul><li>official language minority communities members shape their economic development </li></ul></li>
<li>the intermediate outcome contribute to the ultimate outcome:
	<ul><li>Community economic development and vitality are strengthened</li></ul></li> </ol></details></section>

<h2>Appendix C: Evaluation questions and supporting lines of evidence</h2>
<p>Five contribution agreement signatory organizations have been selected to participate in the document review and key informant interviews. These include: </p>

<p>Contribution agreement signatories in the Yukon, Alberta, and New Brunswick were randomly selected among northern, western, and eastern organizations to ensure regional representation. The organisation in Ontario was selected given the size of the Francophone community that it serves. The organisation in Québec was selected because it is the only one serving Anglophones in Canada. </p>
<p>Documents reviewed included contribution agreements, quarterly activity reports, and annual reports from April 2018 to March 2020. The document review addresses questions 1, 2, 3, and 3.a.  </p>
<p>The key informant interviews were carried out with the leaders and staff of the 5 selected contribution agreement signatories. Interviews address question 3.a as well as enable the collection of data for a GBA+ analysis. Interviews were completed in January 2022 by phone or on MS Teams.</p>
