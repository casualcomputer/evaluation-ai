<p><strong>About the Transition to the Departmental Results Framework (DRF)</strong></p>
<p>The transition to the DRF was driven by the government’s objective to change the reporting framework that was established by the <cite>Policy on Management, Resources and Results Structures</cite> (2010) and the <cite>Policy on Evaluation</cite> (2009). The new requirements of the <cite>Policy on Results</cite> (2016) require all federal departments and agencies to move to an improved performance measurement approach centred on the DRF. For the purposes of this joint engagement, the DRF transition is a continuum comprised of three phases: implementation, roll out and update of the DRF.</p>

<h2>What the Engagement Found</h2>
<h3>Relevance</h3>
<p>The DRF transition is aligned with the Minister of Natural Resources mandate letter and the Treasury Board (TB) <cite>Policy on Results</cite>. The DRF transition planning process was relatively responsive to existing departmental reporting needs and priorities prior to the release of the <cite>Policy on Results</cite> (July 2016).</p>
<h3>Compliance of DRF Tools</h3>
<p>The DRF tools developed by NRCan comply with <cite>Policy on Results</cite> requirements. They were implemented, rolled out, and updated within the timeframe set by the Treasury Board Secretariat (TBS). The work of the Strategic Policy and Innovation sector (SPI) has systematically guided the DRF transition toward compliance.</p>
<h3>Planning Process</h3>
<p>Program Officials indicated relative satisfaction with the adequacy of resources allocated to the process. The planning process was based on internal and external knowledge and best practices, but the planning strategy could have been better documented and more comprehensive, and introduced earlier in the roll-out of the transition project.</p>
<h3>Governance</h3>
<p>In general, the roles and responsibilities for the DRF transition have been carried out in accordance with the requirements of the <cite>Policy on Results</cite> and approved by the Executive Committee and the Performance Measurement, Evaluation and Experimentation Committee (PMEEC). The roles of the different designated functions, especially those of the Chief Information Officer (CIO), the Chief Financial Officer (CFO), and the Chief Human Resources Officer (CHRO), appear to be largely unknown as they apply to the transition and Program Officials do not appear to be sufficiently informed about the different functional roles.</p>
<h3>Engagement Strategy</h3>
<p>Significant efforts were made to engage all NRCan sectors and external stakeholders, including TBS, in the transition to the DRF. However, the joint engagement found that the engagement strategy could also have been better documented, more comprehensive, and introduced earlier in the roll-out of the project. The engagement also noted that the effectiveness of the engagement strategy was assessed differently by the SPI and the other sectors. Most Program Officials and members of the Corporate Planners Network are satisfied with the role they have played in the DRF transition. However, many expressed a desire to know more about the consideration given by managers of the DRF transition to their perspectives and contributions.</p>
<h3>Performance Measures</h3>
<p>To some extent, the DRF transition has resulted in a better definition and understanding of Departmental Results. In terms of opportunities for improvement, several stakeholders stated that there was a need to better integrate the performance indicators (including long-term ones) required by program managers into the DRF. The need for alignment with financial indicators (efficiency) was also highlighted as an important element of program performance measurement.</p>

<p><strong>About the Engagement</strong></p>
<p>The objective of this joint audit and evaluation engagement is to examine the compliance of Natural Resources Canada’s (NRCan’s) transition to the Departmental Results Framework (DRF) with the Treasury Board (TB) <cite>Policy on Results</cite> and to assess the effectiveness of this transition, as well as the impacts of DRF planning and implementation on program management and reporting. The joint engagement covers the period from April 1, 2016, to March 31, 2020. The analysis excludes improvements to the DRF via annual amendments made after March 31, 2020. The 2022–23 DRF amendment process is currently the fourth completed iteration made to continue improvements to the DRF.</p>
<p>NRCan’s Audit and Evaluation Branch (AEB) conducted this engagement in accordance with the TB <cite>Policy on Results</cite> (2016) and the Institute of Internal Auditors’ <cite>International Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing</cite> and the Government of Canada’s <cite>Policy on Internal Audit</cite>. Details on specific engagement questions, methods and limitations are found in the full report.</p>

<li value="4">It is recommended that the ADM Strategic Policy and Innovation (SPI) work with sectors and Program Officials to continue to improve the various elements of the DRF, particularly to increase their usefulness for direct program management including the financial aspect of their performance. To achieve this, SPI must, in concert with other sectors and their planners, develop and roll out an effective strategy for improving program performance indicators and their integration into the DRF. The strategy should take into account indicators related to government-wide policy considerations such as gender-based analysis plus and official languages, where appropriate</li>

<p><strong>Management response: </strong>Management agrees with Recommendation #4.</p>
<p>SPI-PDR, with Program Officials and Sector Planners, will formalize an annual review process that will require Sectors to review and validate the availability, quality, and usefulness of performance indicators and ensure that key priorities (e.g., equity, diversity and inclusion, GBA Plus, official languages) are reflected in their Performance Information Profiles (PIP) and in the DRF. This process will be conducted as part of the implementation of the new PIP Webform.</p>
<p>Program Officials will also be invited to present their PIPs periodically to PMEEC. SPI-PDR will work with AEB to ensure evaluation recommendations about improvements to program performance measurement are considered by Program Officials in PIPs.</p>
