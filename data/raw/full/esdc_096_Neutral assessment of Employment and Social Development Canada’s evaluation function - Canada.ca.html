<h2 id="h2.1">1. Neutral Assessment Report</h2>
<section>
<h3 id="h2.1-h3.1">1.1 Purpose of the Report</h3>
<p>This report sets out the results from the neutral assessment of Employment and Social Development Canada’s (ESDC) evaluation function.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3 id="h2.1-h3.2">1.2 Objectives</h3>
<p>The evaluation function is one (1) of several senior governance functions at ESDC. Its role is to conduct evaluation, which is the systematic and neutral collection and analysis of evidence to judge merit, worth or value. Treasury Board of Canada (TB) Policy sets out the expectations for a federal department’s or agency’s evaluation function in the Policy on Results, July 1, 2016. One (1) of the Policy’s requirements is that deputy heads ensure that a neutral assessment of their departmental evaluation function is conducted at a minimum of once every five (5) years. This is the second neutral assessment of ESDC’s evaluation function.</p>
<p>TB is not prescriptive in terms of the conduct or content of a neutral assessment. Raymond Chabot Grant Thornton Consulting Inc. (RCGT) was engaged by the Internal Audit Services Branch to conduct this neutral assessment of the Evaluation Function at ESDC.</p>
<p>The objectives of the neutral assessment were to address the following questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Does the evaluation function conform to TB’s  expectations?</li>
<li>Is the evaluation organization well-managed?</li>
<li>Is the function adding value to ESDC?</li>
</ol>
</section>
<section>
<h3 id="h2.1-h3.3">1.3 Scope and Approach</h3>
<p>This neutral assessment exercise was conducted over a four-month period beginning in April 2018 and ending in July 2018. It provides findings and conclusions on the state of the function at the time of the assessment. Findings and conclusions related to the evaluation function relate to the practices at the department level; findings and conclusions that relate to the evaluation organization relate to the practices within the Evaluation Directorate.</p>
<p>To conclude on project-level matters, the exercise reviewed documentation from four (4) evaluation projects completed during the past five (5) years.</p>
<p>To conclude on organization- and function-level matters, the exercise examined practices in place at the time of the assessment.</p>
<p>The framework used for this neutral assessment includes three (3) distinct components, focusing on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Governance of the evaluation function;</li>
<li>The evaluation organization’s professional  practice at the organization level and at the project level; and</li>
<li>Monitoring and performance reporting associated  with the evaluation function.</li>
</ul>
<p>The framework includes criteria that were derived from policy, standards, and directives associated with the practice of evaluation. International standards on evaluation were also considered in developing the framework. Additional criteria were included that reflected sound management practices that were applicable to an evaluation function. The framework criteria are included in Section 2.0 of this document.</p>
<p>The neutral assessment was based on an analysis of documentation and interviews. </p>

<h3 id="h2.1-h3.4">1.4 Conclusions from the Neutral Assessment</h3>
<p>The conclusions address the three (3) assessment areas of governance; professional practice; and monitoring and performance reporting. Findings that support these conclusions are provided in section 1.5 of this report.</p>
<p>The neutral assessment determined that ESDC’s evaluation function conforms with:</p>
<ul>
<li>TB’s expectations with regard to governance</li>
<li>Professional practice expectations at the  function level</li>
<li>Professional practice expectations at the  project level</li>
<li>Monitoring and performance reporting  expectations</li>
</ul>
<p>The neutral assessment findings indicate that ESDC’s evaluation function is meeting expectations. Specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>The function conforms to the policy expectations  set out by TB, as well as to other reasonable professional expectations set out  in the neutral assessment framework;</li>
<li>Evidence indicates that the evaluation function  is well-managed; and</li>
<li>Evidence indicates that the evaluation function  is adding important value to the ESDC. </li>
</ul>
<p>The findings that support these conclusions are presented below.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3 id="h2.1-h3.5">1.5 Findings from the Neutral Assessment</h3>
<p>The findings presented in this section inform the conclusions on whether the evaluation function either conforms to expectations, or its conformance to expectations is at risk.</p>
<p>Conformance indicates that processes and practices in place are determined to be in accordance with expectations set out in policy, standards, and directives. Where conformance is at risk, the processes and practices in place have been judged to fall short of expectations, and they negatively impact the evaluation function’s capability to perform its responsibilities fully and in a cost-effective manner.</p>
<p>The summary findings are presented below according to the structure of the neutral assessment framework.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3 id="h2.1-h3.6">1.6 Governance of the Evaluation Function</h3>
<p>The neutral assessment’s governance criteria address responsibilities of the Deputy Head with respect to the evaluation function, the departmental Performance Measurement and Evaluation Committee, and the HoE.</p>
<section>
<h4>1.6.1 Deputy Head Responsibilities: Conforms to Expectations</h4>
<p>The Deputy Head is fulfilling required responsibilities related to governance. The Deputy Head has established an evaluation function, appointed a departmental Performance Measurement and Evaluation Committee and a HoE at an executive level, and has approved an Evaluation Plan. The Deputy Head has approved in a timely manner the completed evaluation reports that were reviewed, including associated management action plans.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h4>1.6.2 Performance Measurement and Evaluation Committee Responsibilities: Conforms to Expectations</h4>
<p>The departmental Performance Measurement and Evaluation Committee is fulfilling the responsibilities set out in the TB Policy on Results. It is mandated to review and approve evaluation-related matters; it meets policy expectations in terms of its composition; and its stated roles and responsibilities meet TB expectations.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h4>1.6.3 Head of Evaluation Responsibilities: Conforms to Expectations</h4>
<p>The HoE is fulfilling required responsibilities related to governance. The Evaluation Directorate conducts its work in a neutral manner; it appears to operate in a cost-effective manner; it supports the departmental Performance Measurement and Evaluation Committee; and evaluators adhere to the TB policy suite that governs evaluation.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h4>1.6.4 Values and Ethics: Conforms to Expectations</h4>
<p>The TB Policy on Results does not set out requirements pertaining to values and ethics. However, evaluators are involved in a wide range of activities that require them to act in a professional and ethical manner. For example, they interact with groups across ESDC, they can interact with ESDC’s outside stakeholders, they can initiate and manage contracts, and they have access to privileged information.</p>
<p>Reviewed documents indicate that the Evaluation Directorate acts professionally and in a manner consistent with federal government values and ethics.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section>
<h3 id="h2.1-h3.7">1.7 The Evaluation Function’s Professional Practice</h3>
<p>The neutral assessment’s professional practice criteria address: planning and conducting work at the function level; planning, conducting and reporting at the project level; and managing the evaluation function. The summary findings are presented below.</p>
<section>
<h4>1.7.1 Planning and Conducting at the Function Level</h4>
<p><strong>Evaluation Planning at the Function Level: Conforms to Expectations</strong></p>
<p>Measures are in place related to the evaluation plan. Documentation indicates that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adequate measures are in place for the  development of the ESDC’s evaluation plan.</li>
<li>The evaluation plan is approved and  communicated.</li>
<li>The most recent evaluation plan presents a  strategy and the rationale for the strategy. The coverage decisions are  suitably explained.</li>
<li>Evaluations have been conducted within the  general timeframes for which they were planned.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Roles Related to Evaluation and Performance Measurement: Conforms to Expectations</strong></p>
<p>The neutral assessment analysis determined that the evaluation function is meeting expectations related to conducting evaluations. The completed evaluations that were reviewed addressed core issues.</p>
<p>The neutral assessment analysis determined that the evaluation organization is meeting expectations related to departmental performance measurement.</p>
<p>With respect to performance measurement at the function level, deputy heads are to ensure that that ongoing performance measurement is implemented throughout the department so that sufficient performance information is available to effectively support the evaluation of programs. The HoE has been involved in providing comments on performance measurement information in support of evaluation, reviewing Treasury Board submissions, and providing advice on departmental performance measurement strategies and frameworks.  </p>
</section>
<section>
<h4>1.7.2 Planning, Conduct, and Reporting at the Project Level</h4>
<p>The following assessment is based on the analysis of documentation available from four (4) completed ESDC evaluation projects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Evaluation of the Extension of Employment  Insurance Part I Benefit for Long-Tenured Workers – August 2014</li>
<li>Evaluation of Workplace Information and Research  Activities of the Labour Program – November 2015</li>
<li>Evaluation of the Enabling Fund for Official  Language Minority Communities – March 2017</li>
<li>Homelessness Partnering Strategy - Summative  Evaluation – January 2018</li>
</ul>
<p>The neutral assessment analysis at the project level includes: project planning, conduct, reporting, and use.</p>
<p><strong>Evaluation Project Planning: Conforms to Expectations</strong></p>
<p>According to the TB Directive on Results, plans should discuss project objectives; primary evaluation issues; resource use; risk and complexity; approach, design and methodology; evaluator competencies; and relevant policies.</p>
<p>The analysis of project information determined that a formal terms of reference was completed for all projects, and that essential project information was included in these terms of reference.</p>
<p>A noteworthy strength of the four (4) reviewed evaluations was the development of an Evaluability Assessment. These assessments provided considerable value added to the discussions about the respective evaluation’s design, focus and expected utility. Interviewed executives indicated that these reports added important value to evaluation projects.</p>
<p><strong>Conduct of Evaluation Projects: Conforms to Expectations</strong></p>
<p>The conduct of evaluation projects includes project leadership, stakeholder consultation, project management and control, use of evidence, and information control.</p>
<p>The evaluation projects were led by ESDC’s HoE, and respective stakeholders were consulted as part of each project, within the limitation of the methodology selected. The evaluation reports indicate that conclusions were based on evidence.</p>
<p>Practices are in place related to project management and control, and information control.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h4>1.7.3 Evaluation Project Reporting: Conforms to Expectations</h4>
<p>Project reporting includes the completeness and communication of evaluation reports, and their accessibility to the public.</p>
<p>The reports for the reviewed evaluations are clear, meet the requirements of the Standard on Evaluation, include management responses and action plans where required, and have been submitted to Treasury Board Secretariat.</p>
<p>The completed evaluation reports are posted on ESDC’s website.</p>
<p>The reviewed reports would be more useful and complete if they indicated to the reader the limitations of the methodologies and the resulting impacts on interpreting the findings and conclusions. This could be achieved through an overall statement about the validity and strength of the methodology, as well as cautionary statements in the text itself. These limitations are discussed in projects’ Evaluability Assessments; however, readers of the final report have no indication of these limitations and their impact.</p>
<p><strong>Use of Evaluations: Conforms to Expectations</strong></p>
<p>This requirement includes the use of evaluation findings by the Deputy Head to support senior decision-making. Interviews conducted as part of the neutral assessment indicated that results from evaluations have been used by ESDC’s executive level in program decision-making.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h4>1.7.4 Evaluation Competencies: Conforms to Expectations</h4>
<p>The evaluation projects reviewed were conducted by ESDC evaluation personnel, who were experienced evaluators, and by consulting firms that had the qualifications required to execute the work.
  </p>
</section>
</section>
<section>
<h3 id="h2.1-h3.8">1.8 Monitoring and Performance Reporting of the Evaluation Function</h3>
<p>The neutral assessment’s Monitoring and Performance Reporting criteria address annual and ongoing reporting obligations.</p>
<section>
<h4>1.8.1 Monitoring and Performance Reporting by the Head of Evaluation: Conforms to Expectations</h4>
<p>The HoE reports evaluation-related matters to the Performance Measurement and Evaluation Committee. Linkages are in place between ESDC’s performance measurement regime and the evaluation function. The HoE reports to the Committee on the implementation of management action plans. Reports have been produced on the state of performance measurement in support of evaluations, and these have been presented to the proper oversight committees.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h4>1.8.2 Monitoring and Performance Reporting by the Deputy Head: Conforms to Expectations</h4>
<p>Actions taken by ESDC’s Deputy Head have assured that the department’s evaluation function conforms to policy expectations. This neutral assessment is a component of the performance reporting activity. Also, the HoE provides TBS with information annually on behalf of the Deputy Head.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section>
<h3 id="h2.1-h3.9">1.9 Recommended Action</h3>
