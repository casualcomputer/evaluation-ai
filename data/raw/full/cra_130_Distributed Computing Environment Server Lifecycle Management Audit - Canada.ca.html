<p><strong>Background:</strong> The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) has approximately 2,000 servers <a href="#_ftn1" id="_ftnref1" title="">[Footnote 1]</a> located nationally outside the Data Centres to deliver solutions to meet its program objectives for the Distributed Computing Environment (DCE). Roughly half of these servers are managed by IT support organizations within ITB, the other Headquarters (HQ) branches and the regions, referred together in this report as “IT support organizations”. The other half is managed separately by other groups. The Information Technology Branch (ITB), Data and Technology Infrastructure Management (DTIM), Distributed Services Directorate (DSD) is responsible for the national governance framework for the DCE. ITB-DTIM-DSD has functional and financial authority for national IT support in the regions only, but works with HQ IT Support Directors to ensure that the DCE platform operates consistently in regions and HQ branches.</p> <p>For the purposes of this audit, DCE servers are servers located in buildings nationwide, excluding the Data Centres. They are categorized as core and non-core servers. Both types are referred together in this report as “servers”. Core servers include file, print, email and other common infrastructure servers. These servers are funded by an ongoing core server renewal plan. They are managed by IT support organizations. Non-core servers include application, database, Intranet and local lab servers.

<p>In support of its program objectives the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) relies on information technology systems. Within CRA, the Information Technology Branch (ITB) has responsibility for managing and operating the network and computing infrastructure <a href="#_ftn2" id="_ftnref2" title="">[Footnote 2]</a>.<br/><br/> For the purposes of this audit, Distributed Computing Environment (DCE) servers <a href="#_ftn3" id="_ftnref3" title="">[Footnote 3]</a> are servers located in buildings nationwide, excluding the Data Centres. They are categorized as core and non-core servers. Both types are referred together in this report as “servers”.</p> <p>Core servers include file, print, email and other common infrastructure servers. These servers are funded by an ongoing core server renewal plan. They are managed by IT support organizations within ITB, the other Headquarters (HQ) branches and the regions, referred together in this report as “IT support organizations”. Non-core servers include application, database, Intranet and local lab servers. They are funded by branches and regions (as opposed to the core server renewal plan), and are managed and supported by IT support organizations and other groups.</p> <p>Servers should be managed according to CRA Materiel Management Lifecycle policy, which is comprised of four phases: needs analysis, acquisition, operation and use, and disposal.</p> <p>Over the past eight years ITB led several national initiatives to improve the lifecycle management of servers, including obtaining central funding for the DCE core server renewal and working with Finance and Administration Branch (F&amp;A) to establish a Supply Arrangement for the procurement of servers. The Managed Distributed Environment (MDE) program was established to provide improved and consistent delivery of IT services, reduce the complexity of the DCE and the total cost of ownership, as well as position the Agency to adapt to new technologies in response to business requirements. A horizontal review of the MDE identified the need to better understand the business value related to non-core servers. </p> <p>As a result, the Server Clean-up initiative was started to ensure that all servers were appropriately funded and managed. Inconsistencies between data sources made it difficult to determine the current status, role, and location of active and decommissioned servers. The Server Asset Management Strategy was then initiated to address the weaknesses found in the Server Clean-up initiative. As part of this initiative ITB started producing monthly analysis reports using Service Desk <a href="#_ftn4" id="_ftnref4" title="">[Footnote 4]</a> and other automated tools. The August 2007 report identified a total of 2,313 servers, of which 500 (389 in HQ) did not have an identified purpose.</p>

<p>The objective of the audit was to assess the extent to which key management controls are established for DCE server lifecycle management.</p> <p>The scope of this audit was national and included ITB (excluding data centres), Human Resources Branch, F&amp;A, Public Affairs Branch, Legislative Policy and Regulatory Affairs Branch, as well as the Pacific, Prairie and Ontario regions.</p> <p>The audit methodology included a questionnaire which was distributed to key management contacts having responsibility for DCE server lifecycle management, for further distribution within their areas of responsibility. The questionnaires received were analyzed and included 676 core servers and 803 non-core servers, for a total of 1,479 servers. File reviews, interviews with staff and management in ITB and F&amp;A, and follow-up enquiries related to the questionnaire submissions with managers and staffs were also conducted.</p> <p>The examination phase was conducted from November 2007 to September 2008. </p> <p>The audit was conducted in accordance with the <em>International Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing</em> and the <em>Information Systems Audit and Control Association’s (ISACA)</em> ‘Control Objective for Information and Related Technology’ (COBIT).</p>

<p>A complete governance framework to direct, control and support DCE server lifecycle management should exist. All organizations within the Agency that manage servers should be included in the governance framework. Industry best practices (COBIT) defines governance as leadership, organizational structures, processes, controls, tools, measurements, reporting, and monitoring to ensure that the enterprise’s IT sustains and extends the organization’s strategies and objectives.</p> <p>CRA policies address materiel management lifecycle and security requirements for servers. ITB, Data and Technology Infrastructure Management (DTIM), Distributed Services Directorate (DSD) has an established governance framework to direct, control and support DCE server lifecycle management. However, there are groups managing servers that are not included within this framework. There is no single point of accountability for all servers in the Agency, and there is no consensus as to what is considered a valid DCE server. </p> <p>ITB-DTIM-DSD is mandated to provide a stable, secure, managed, effective and integrated DCE. Clear accountabilities and linkages are in place within DSD and with other stakeholders. ITB-DTIM-DSD provides functional direction and guidance to IT support organizations, and is evolving its national IT Service Management based on a global standard, IT Infrastructure Library (ITIL), for the consistent and measurable delivery of IT support services. Well-defined guidelines and protocols are established for developing, approving, distributing and conducting official communications for all distributed services. </p> <p>To improve DCE asset management within ITB, branch senior management approved a proposal in February 2008 to make ITB-DTIM-DSD the program owner of DCE asset management within ITB from acquisition to disposal (excluding the data centres). The resulting changes to processes and procedures are underway and will be completed by the end of March 2009. </p> <p>Without an Agency-wide governance structure, it is difficult to manage and report on the physical and financial information of all servers. A more inclusive governance framework would improve the accuracy and completeness of national inventories, facilitate effective and efficient planning, reduce duplication of effort, and allow management to accurately assess program costs and meet the needs for DCE replacement or improvements.</p> <p><strong> <em>Recommendation</em> </strong> </p> <p><strong> <em>CRA should expand the ITB-DTIM-DSD governance framework to include all organizations managing servers.</em> </strong> </p> <p><em>Action Plan</em> </p> <p><em>ITB will develop a strategy, costing impacts and proposal to strengthen DCE server governance to include all areas managing servers. This new governance would require Agency Management Committee (AMC) approval. Note that IT Governance has been identified as an ITB risk within the Agency’s Integrated Risk Management framework, and analysis is currently underway to develop a mitigation strategy and plan. Target Completion – Q4 2009-2010.</em> </p>

<p>CRA policy states that needs analysis, cost-benefit analysis, risk assessments and forecasting should be consistently completed for server acquisitions.</p> <p>ITB has processes in place to address needs, cost-benefit and forecasting analysis for core servers and is currently addressing Threat and Risk Assessment (TRA) requirements (see Section 2.2). However, policy requirements are not always met for the acquisition of non-core servers, as per the following questionnaire results:</p> <ul>
<li>41%, or 13 of 32 respondents that purchased non-core servers did not complete needs analysis, 47% did not complete cost-benefit analysis, and 50% did not complete forecasting; and</li>
<li>59%, or 10 of 17 respondents managing non-core servers that require submission of a Technical Security Review (TSR) or TRA did not submit either to the appropriate security groups.</li>
</ul> <p>The existing server acquisition process managed by ITB does not address all policy requirements for non-core server acquisition, and there is no compliance monitoring. Stronger controls would better position the Agency to realize value for money, efficiency gains, and mitigate security risks.</p> <p><strong> <em>Recommendations</em> </strong> </p> <p><strong> <em>ITB-DTIM-DSD should improve existing controls to ensure that policy requirements are complied with for non-core server acquisitions.</em> </strong> </p> <p><strong> <em>F&amp;A, Security, Risk Management and Internal Affairs Directorate (SRMIAD) should follow up with the questionnaire respondents who were required by policy to submit a TSR or TRA for existing non-core servers but have not.</em> </strong> </p> <p><em>Action Plan </em> </p> <p><em>ITB-DTIM-DSD will improve the procurement process to ensure that policy requirements for needs analysis, cost-benefit analysis, risk assessments and forecasting are complied with.

<p>CRA policy states that procedures shall be developed, documented and implemented for addressing changes and problems with production systems. Key stakeholders should be included in a framework that integrates relevant policies and procedures. Finally, configuration procedures should be integrated with change management, incident management and problem management procedures, as defined in COBIT.</p> <p>ITB-DTIM-DSD National Standard Operating Procedures (NSOPs) are in place, communicated and followed by most IT support organizations, but at least half of the groups outside IT support organizations do not follow documented operating procedures, apart from hardware disposal activities.</p> <p>Questionnaire results from IT support organizations indicated that:</p> <ul>
<li>93%, or 26 of 28 respondents follow the Hardware Receive, Deploy, Repair, and Replace NSOPs;</li>
<li>96% follow the Hardware Disposal NSOP;</li>
<li>86% follow the Hardware Move, and Planned Infrastructure Monitoring NSOPs; and</li>
<li>71% have a monitoring process in place to ensure that server activity NSOPs are followed.</li>
</ul> <p>Questionnaire results from groups outside IT support organizations indicated that:</p> <ul>
<li>50%, or 11 of 22 respondents do not follow documented local operating procedures for hardware receive and planned infrastructure monitoring; and</li>
<li>64% do not follow documented local operating procedures for hardware deploy, repair, move, and replace.</li>
</ul> <p>The NSOPs are based on best practices and address relevant policy requirements, but the development framework needs improvement, as per the following observations:</p> <ul>
<li>There is no formal review process in place to ensure the published NSOPs are kept current as priority was placed on developing new NSOPs.</li>
<li>ITB and regional IT Directors sign-off on NSOPs, but HQ branches are not included in the sign-off process.</li>
</ul> <p>More inclusive use of NSOPs would mitigate operational and security risks, and support knowledge management. Up-to-date NSOPs would result in the efficient and consistent management of servers.</p> <p><strong> <em>Recommendations</em> </strong> </p> <p><strong> <em>ITB-DTIM-DSD should:</em> </strong> </p> <ul>

<p>CRA policy states that managers are required to accurately account for and report on capital assets ($10,000 or more) in CAS for the year-end certification process. Not all managers are consistently accounting for and reporting on capital assets. The following findings were noted:<strong></strong> </p> <ul>
<li>For Fiscal Year 2006-2007, two HQ branches and one region did not submit the “Accounting for Capital Assets” certificate and corresponding Asset Balance Reports. Additionally, one region signed off on their certificate even though the Asset Balance Reports were not verified by 11 managers.</li>
<li>Serial numbers are not always recorded in the CAS Asset Master Record (AMR) for capital assets as required by policy, as the AMR data field for inputting the serial number is not mandatory. This results in serial numbers not being entered consistently, creating difficulties when reconciling AMR records with physical assets. </li>
<li>Capital assets received and recorded in CAS are tracked by other organizations using multiple asset-tracking tools not linked to CAS. This impairs the reconciliation of capital assets in CAS.</li>
<li>Capital assets with an AMR in CAS are not consistently removed from active status when they are disposed. </li>

<h4> <span id="_Toc216591869"> </span> <span id="_Toc204873404">3.6 Server Network Operating System License Management</span> </h4>
<p>Network Operating System (NOS) licenses should be consistently managed to ensure compliance with licensing agreements. CRA policy states that managers are responsible for ensuring the availability of information systems and processes for the accurate recording, tracking and inventory of materiel under their control. Furthermore, COBIT states that periodic reviews of installed software should be conducted to ensure licensing compliance.</p> <p>NOS license management needs to be improved as NOS licenses are not consistently managed. Monitoring conducted by ITB does not include all servers, and not all managers responsible for non-core servers maintain an inventory of NOS licenses, as required by policy.</p> <p>ITB-DTIM-DSD works with F&amp;A-AD to track the total number of licenses included in the CRA Enterprise License Agreement (ELA). ITB-DTIM-DSD also monitors the NOS license requirements for active core servers in the HQ branches and regions under the ELA. Non-core servers are not covered under the ELA, but non-core server NOS licenses purchased since 2002 have been added to the ELA, and ITB-DTIM-DSD does not track which licenses were added for core versus non-core servers.</p> <p>Fifty-one percent, or 21 of 41 non-core server questionnaire respondents indicated that they do not maintain an inventory of NOS licenses for various reasons such as: taking over responsibility from other groups without receiving NOS licenses; assuming it is the responsibility of either the HQ function, ITB, or the local client; or that they were unable to find their license documentation.</p> <p>There are multiple areas responsible for managing the NOS licensing for servers which creates confusion and inefficiencies.<strong></strong>Furthermore, the current processes could result in license liability and increased costs for the Agency.</p> <p><strong> <em>Recommendations</em> </strong> </p> <p><strong> <em>ITB-DTIM-DSD should take the lead, working with F&amp;A-AD to centralize the management and monitoring of NOS licensing for all servers, and communicate the requirements to affected areas.</em> </strong> </p> <p><em>Action Plan</em> </p> <p><em>ITB-DTIM-DSD is working with F&amp;A-AD to address this issue. In particular, processes are being developed and implemented which will stop the disparity between hardware assets and licenses, and that, where required, ensure that additional licenses are purchased for new servers. Additionally, ITB-DTIM-DSD will be launching an RFI to examine the feasibility of implementing an Agency-wide software inventory tool. Target Completion – Q4 2009-2010.</em> </p>

<h4> <span id="_Toc216591871">4.1 Hard Drive Overwrite Utility Software</span> </h4>
The Agency should have an approved and effective overwrite utility software for the permanent removal of data from server hard drives. Furthermore, COBIT states that procedures should be defined and implemented to ensure that business requirements for protection of sensitive data and software are met when data and hardware are disposed or transferred. <p>The overwrite utility software recommended in CRA policy is not always effective on server hard drives. Supporting documents referenced in policy state the limitations of this software. In addition, there is no process in place to ensure that an effective tool is available in a timely and ongoing fashion. Despite the limitation of this software, 54%, or 27 of 50 questionnaire respondents have used it on server hard drives. </p> <p>There is a risk that data is not permanently erased prior to server hard drive transfer or disposal. Some areas are stockpiling or destroying hard drives to address the risk. CRA needs to ensure the ongoing availability of an effective tool to permanently erase Agency data, which would also support sustainable development.</p> <p><strong> <em>Recommendations</em> </strong> </p> <p><strong> <em>F&amp;A-SRMIAD, working with </em> </strong> <strong> <em>ITB-OSD-ITSSD</em> </strong> <strong> <em>,</em> </strong> <strong> <em> should immediately communicate to areas managing servers, interim procedures for transferring and disposing of server hard drives until an approved overwrite utility software is available.</em> </strong> </p> <p><strong> <em>F&amp;A-SRMIAD should take the lead, working with ITB-OSD-ITSSD to replace the current overwrite utility software, as a priority, with a tool that permanently removes all data from server hard drives.</em> </strong> </p> <p><em>Action Plan </em> </p> <p> F&amp;A-SRMIAD, in collaboration with ITB-OSD-ITSSD, informed responsible areas in Q3 2008-2009 how to manage the transfer and disposal of server hard drives until an approved solution is available.</p> <p><em>A National Master Standing Offer (NMSO), including numerous media erasure/destruction products, was published in October 2008. ITB-OSD-ITSSD will be responsible for evaluating and recommending product(s) that CRA can procure and integrate based on best practices. Decisions on procurement and procedures for use will be done jointly between F&amp;A-SRMIAD and ITB-OSD-ITSSD. Erasure/destruction procedures will include concise instructions for when hard drives are to be sanitized and when they are to be destroyed. The NMSO product list is currently being reviewed and products assessed. Current thoughts are that CRA will require a blended Software/Hardware solution. ITB will issue a communiqué to the field advising them of review status and that hard drives should be stored locally until such time as the solution is available for deployment.

<h4> <span id="_Toc216591872">4.2 Reusing End-of-Life Servers</span> </h4>
<p>A policy should define the Agency’s position on and conditions for the reuse of end-of-life servers.</p> <p>CRA policy promotes the reuse of moveable assets within the Agency when practical, feasible and cost-effective, but does not take into consideration the risks related to IT assets.

<p>CRA has policies in place to address materiel management lifecycle and security requirements for servers. ITB has an established governance framework to direct, control and support DCE server lifecycle management. However, there are groups managing servers that are not included within this framework. There is no single point of accountability for all servers in the Agency, and there is no consensus as to what is considered a valid DCE server. Consequently, servers are managed inconsistently by various groups using different processes and tools. </p> <p>The absence of a single IT asset management system also contributes to the use of multiple tools to manage servers. As a result, there may be duplication of effort and inaccurate national inventories. Management may not have complete and reliable data to accurately assess program costs and meet the needs for DCE replacement or improvements.</p> <p>Inconsistencies in managing server Network Operating System (NOS) licences could result in license liability and increased costs for the Agency.</p> <p>CRA needs to ensure that Agency data is permanently removed from server hard drives prior to transfer or disposal. The overwrite utility software recommended in CRA policy for the permanent removal of data has limitations with certain server hard drives.</p> <p>To better manage servers, the Agency needs to improve and expand the established governance framework to include all areas that manage servers, strengthen controls to manage servers in a consistent manner, improve inventory control, and ensure that security of confidential data is not jeopardized.</p>
