<h2 id="h2.04">Executive summary</h2>
<p>This report presents the evaluation findings of the Extended  Duration of Employment Insurance Regular Benefits and the Pilot Project  Relating to Extended Benefits (Pilot 15).   Both initiatives extended the EI regular entitlement by five weeks.  However, each initiative had different policy  objectives.</p>
<p>The first EDB policy objective was to stimulate spending  considering the uncertainty of the 2008/2009 economic downturn.  Its second objective was to reduce EI  exhaustion rate.  The EDB extended EI  regular benefit entitlement nationwide by five weeks and increased the maximum  entitlement to 50 weeks from 45.  The EDB  initiative received Royal Assent on March 12, 2009 and came into effect on  March 1, 2009.  It concluded on September  11, 2010.</p>
<p>Pilot Project No. 15 was a two-year pilot project reintroducing Pilot Project No. 10 with the objectives of testing the impact of extending the number of weeks of benefits  in economic regions of relatively high unemployment during a period of economic  recovery to reduce the number of seasonal workers facing an income gap and  assessing the impact of a regional unemployment rate-based automatic  termination trigger. Pilot 15 was in effect in 21 EI economic regions where the unemployment rate was 8% or more, from September 12, 2010 to September 15, 2012. The automatic termination trigger provision excluded threes regions from the pilot since their unemployment rates dropped below 8% for 12 consecutive  months.</p>
<section>
<h3>Evaluation approach</h3>
<p>This evaluation report is primarily based on the technical study “Extended Duration of EI Regular Benefits: Evaluation Technical Study” (ESDC, 2015), which is a descriptive and econometric study of a sample of completed EI claims where only regular benefits were paid.</p>
<p>For both initiatives, the evaluation examined the take up by EI claimants of the additional weeks of benefits provided and the impact on the length of EI claims as well as on the likelihood of exhausting entitlements and benefits during the pilot periods.</p>
<p>An analysis of the total benefits paid associated to the additional weeks of entitlement was conducted for both initiatives. Although the assessment of the macro-economic impact of the EDB initiative was not in scope of this evaluation, the total benefits paid analysis provide an estimate of the direct spending stimulus of the EBD initiative.</p>
<p>In the case of Pilot 15, the evaluation explored the extent to which the pilot helped address the income gap issues related to seasonal workers in the pilot regions and the effectiveness of the termination trigger provision.</p>
</section>
<!-- END h3 -->
<section>
<h3>Evaluation findings</h3>
<p>The evaluation provides key findings on the EDB initiative and Pilot Project 15.</p>
<p>The evaluation found EDB to be successful in that the initiative provided an estimated spending stimulus of 2.5 billion dollars between March 9, 2008 and September 11, 2010 for which 57% ($1.41 billion) is attributed to the additional EDB weeks paid and 43% ($1.09 billion) is attributed to increased use of regular entitlement among all EI claimants.</p>
<p>The EDB initiative resulted in 34% of regular claimants using additional benefits, of which 76% used the entire additional 5 weeks. In addition, the EDB initiative allowed all claimants, not only claimants who used the additional weeks, to remain on EI for 1.6 weeks longer on average and to reduce entitlement benefit exhaustion by 5.3 percentage points.</p>
<p>Results for Pilot Project No. 15 are mixed. Pilot Project No. 15 met its goal of reducing the number of seasonal workers facing an income gap with a 3.3 percentage point probability decrease and also led to a decrease of the income gap length of seasonal income gappers of 2.2 weeks on average. However, only 3.2% of the total 558 million of additional benefit paid during Pilot 15 period was used by seasonal income gappers. This indicates that although Pilot Project No. 15 improved the situation of seasonal gappers, the measure was too broad for the stated goal.</p>
<p>Furthermore, based on the facts that claimants' exhaustion of benefits and number of weeks used were similar before and after the trigger, the regional termination trigger included with Pilot 15 was found to be successful both in its timing and design.</p>

<section>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p> The testing of increasing the number of weeks of benefits available to some claimants began with EI Pilot Project No. 6.  Pilot 6 was introduced for a two-year period in 2004 in 24 regions.  The pilot was re-introduced as a new pilot project, Pilot Project No. 10, for a period of 18 months in 21 regions in 2006 and was extended in 2007 for a further period of 18 months until May 31, 2009.  Both pilot projects tested the costs and impact of extending the number of weeks of benefits in selected economic regions. 	  More specifically, they tested whether providing more weeks of benefits would reduce the number of seasonal workers facing an income gap with neither EI benefits nor employment income (referred to as "gappers"), and whether there would be associated behavioural effects.  Pilot 10 ceased to have effect in February 2009 during the economic recession, when the EI Act was amended via the Budget Implementation Act, 2009 to introduce the Extended Duration of Employment Insurance Regular Benefits (EDB). </p>
</section>
<!-- END h3 -->
<section>
<h3>Extended Duration of Employment Insurance Regular Benefits (EDB)</h3>
<p>The EDB was intended as a temporary stimulus measure as part of a broader response to the recession of 2009 and to reduce EI exhaustion rates during the recession.  EDB temporarily provided additional support to unemployed workers facing transitions in tough economic times by providing claimants with five additional weeks of benefits.  In addition, the maximum duration of benefits available under the EI Program in regions of high unemployment has been increased from 45 weeks to 50.  The temporary measure came into effect on March 1, 2009, with extra weeks available to individuals who had an open claim on March 1, 2009, and were still unemployed.  EDB concluded on September 11, 2010 and was followed seamlessly by Pilot 15.</p>
</section>
<!-- END h3 -->
<section>
<h3>EI Pilot Project No. 15</h3>
<p>Pilot Project No. 15 was based on the same parameters and included the same economic regions as Pilot Project No. 10, and allowed further testing through a period of economic recovery.  In addition, it tested the impact of a regional unemployment rate-based trigger, which removed some participating regions from the pilot when their regional unemployment rate fell below 8% for 12 consecutive months.  More specifically, the pilot ended on September 24, 2011 in St. John's (Newfoundland and Labrador); on March 24, 2012 in Chicoutimi-Jonquière (Quebec) and on June 23, 2012 in Sudbury (Ontario).  The pilot ran until September 15, 2012 and was allowed to sunset at that time.</p>
</section>
<!-- END h3 -->
<section>
<h3>Considerations</h3>
<p>The EDB and subsequent Pilot 15 were introduced in different economic periods with different policy objective: the first one in a time of recession and the second one in a  time of recovery.  This could explain the broad assistance beyond the seasonal gappers that the evaluation rightfully points out for Pilot 15, but may also put the cost of the initiatives into perspective, as Pilot 15 was seen as a stimulus measure.</p>
<p>In addition, a number of EI pilots were in force during the EDB and Pilot 15 which were intended to change claimant's behavior both on and off claim.  These include the Best 14 Weeks, Working While on Claim, and NERE pilots.  While this report controls for all of these pilots, the changing parameters within each pilot complicates the analysis over time.</p>
<p>It is also important to remember other key differences between the EDB and Pilot 15.  Specifically, the EDB was available nationally and increased the maximum insurable weeks from 45 to 50 weeks. The report does reflect these differences and this is only pointed out here for further emphasis.</p>
<p>Finally, the inclusion of an unemployment based trigger in Pilot 15's design was a first and the Skills and Employment Branch is pleased that the evaluation finds that termination trigger was successful in terms of its timing and design.</p>
</section>
<!-- END h3 -->
<section>
<h3>Key conclusions</h3>
<p>The Skills and Employment Branch welcomes the findings in the report and since EDB and Pilot 15 both were temporary measures with different policy objectives, no overall recommendations are made.</p>
<p>The evaluation points out that both initiatives were successful in terms of reducing the entitlement exhaustion rate.  However, this came at a cost as the increased use of benefits was observed among all claimants, not just among those who used additional weeks of benefits.  As discussed in the considerations section, the wide reach of the assistance was part of stimulus package in response to a recession.</p>
<p>The Branch also appreciates the lessons learned from the evaluation with regard to the testing and evaluation of the unemployment rate based trigger.</p>

<h2 id="h2.06">1. Introduction</h2>
<section>
<h3 id="h2.06-h3.01">1.1 Overview</h3>
<p>This report presents the findings of the evaluation of the Extended Duration of Employment Insurance Regular Benefits  and Pilot Project Relating to Extended Benefits (Pilot 15). These are two successive Employment Insurance (EI) initiatives geared towards increasing EI entitlement for Canadians filing regular benefit claims, each with different policy objectives.</p>
<p>Budget 2009 introduced several stimulus measures designed to soften the effect of the economic downturn on Canadians. A number of measures were geared specifically towards workers who experienced job separations during that period and were expected to experience job market impacts due to the decrease in labour demand and tightening labour market conditions. One of those measures was the EDB. Following the downturn, Pilot Project No. 15 was introduced to test the impact of extending EI benefits during a period of economic recovery for seasonal claimants who regularly face income gaps after exhausting their EI claim.</p>

<h2 id="h2.07">2. Description and timeline of initiatives</h2>
<section>
<h3 id="h2.07-h3.01">2.1 Extended duration of employment insurance regular benefits</h3>
<p>The EDB was introduced and implemented nationwide as a response to the 2008/2009 economic downturn.  Between May, 2008 and August, 2009, the overall Canadian unemployment rate increased from 6.3 to 8.7 percent.  It was expected that the average duration of unemployment would likewise increase.</p>
<p>The initiative had two policy objectives: 1) to stimulate spending; and 2) to reduce EI exhaustion rate.</p>
<p>More specifically, the rationale for the initiative as stated in the 2009 Budget plan was to respond to a need for additional support in uncertain times, and to:</p>
<p>"…provide all regular EI clients with the reassurance that they will have financial support for a longer period while they find new employment, should it be required.  It will also provide additional income support to unemployed Canadians who would otherwise have exhausted their benefits."<sup id="fn1-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn1"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>1</a></sup></p>
<p>EDB received Royal Assent on March 12, 2009 and came into effect on March 1, 2009.  It extended EI entitlement by five weeks and increased the maximum allowable EI entitlement from 45 to 50 weeks.</p>
<p>The extended benefits applied retroactively to EI claims with benefit periods that did not end prior to March 1, 2009 (i.e. for claims established as early as March 9, 2008) to claims established up to September 11, 2010.  Depending on their insurable hours of employment and the unemployment rate in their regions of residence; some claimants received the additional benefit entitlement after exhausting their original entitlement and prior to finding employment.</p>

<section>
<h3 id="h2.07-h3.02">2.2 Pilot Project no. 15</h3>
<p>Pilot Project No.15 was a two-year re-introduction of Pilot Project No 10.  Pilot No.10 was established for the purpose of testing the costs and impact of extending the number of weeks of benefits in 21 economic regions of relatively high unemployment.  More specifically, it tested whether providing five additional weeks of benefits would reduce the number of seasonal workers facing a gap between the exhaustion of their EI benefits and the resumption of their seasonal employment income and whether there would be associated behavioral effects.</p>
<p>Pilot Project No.15 was introduced from September 12, 2010 to September 15, 2012 based on the same parameters and included in the same 21 EI economic regions (see <a href="#h2.11">Appendix A – Pilot Regions</a>), as the previous Pilot Project No.10 to allow for further testing during a period of economic recovery as well as to assess the impact of a regional unemployment rate-based automatic termination trigger.  The automatic termination trigger provision excluded regions from the pilot if their unemployment rate was below 8% for 12 consecutive months.<sup id="fn2-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn2"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>2</a></sup></p>
<p>The three excluded EI regions and the date of exclusion are as follows.</p>
<ul>
<li>St. John's, excluded from Pilot 15 on September 24, 2011</li>
<li>Chicoutimi-Jonquiere, excluded from Pilot 15 on March 24, 2012</li>
<li>Sudbury, excluded from Pilot 15 on June 23, 2012</li>

<h3 id="h2.07-h3.03">2.3 Evaluation approach</h3>
<p>This evaluation report is primarily based on the technical study titled: Extended Duration of EI Regular Benefits: Evaluation Technical Study (ESDC, 2015).  A comprehensive discussion on the methodologies as well as detailed econometric results can be found in the technical study.  Also, for an overview of the methodology, see <a href="#h2.16">Appendix F – Data, Definitions and Methodology</a>.</p>
<p>The econometric analysis used for this report takes into  account and controls for a number of temporary EI measures in effect during the  EDB and the Pilot 15 initiatives. These temporary EI measures included:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Extension of EI Regular Benefits for Long-Tenured Workers (EEILTW) which provided, in addition to the EDB, further entitlement in the number of weeks of regular benefits to claimants who had not drawn on benefits extensively in the previous five years, a group of claimants referred as long-tenured workers (LTW).  The EEILTW provided up to 20 weeks of additional regular benefits for claims established between January 4, 2009, and September 11, 2010.</li>
<li>Calculating Benefit Rate Based on Claimant's 14 Highest Weeks of Insurable Earnings Pilot Projects (Pilot Projects Nos. 7, 11 and 16) which were implemented between October 30, 2005 and June 23, 2012. Under the Best 14 Weeks pilots, the average weekly earnings were determined by taking the average of the highest or best 14 weeks of insurable earnings that fell during the qualifying period. If a claimant accepted additional weeks of work beyond the 14 weeks at a lower salary, the level of EI benefits would remain the same.</li>
<li>Pilot Projects Providing Increased Access to Employment and Unemployment Benefits for New Entrants and Re-entrants (NERE) (Pilot 9 and 13) which were implemented between December 11, 2005 and December 4, 2010. NERE pilots tested the labour market impacts of decreasing the number of hours of insurable employment required for new entrants and re-entrants to the labour force to qualify for benefits. The NERE pilot reduced the EI entrance requirements for NEREs from 910 hours to 840 hours and encouraged the use of EI training benefits by marginal NEREs.</li>
<li>Four different working while on claim (WWC) pilot projects (Pilot Projects Nos. 8, 12, 17 and 18) were implemented between July 5, 2005 and March 9, 2013.  Pilot 8, 12 and 17 increased the maximum allowable earnings while on claim without a reduction to benefits from the greatest of $50 or 25% of the weekly benefit amount to the larger of $75 or 40% of the weekly benefit. Pilot 8 was implemented in 23 economic regions from December 11, 2005 to December 6, 2008, where Pilot 12 and 17 were implemented nationwide between December 7, 2008 and August 4, 2012. Under Pilot 18, claimants can keep 50 cents of their EI benefits for every dollar earned, up to 90% of the weekly insurable earnings. Pilot 18 was introduced on August 5, 2012 and concluded on August 1, 2015.</li>

<h2 id="h2.08">3. Findings</h2>
<p>This section discusses the impacts and costs of EDB and Pilot 15 separately. The evaluation's findings are focused on the direct impacts and costs of these initiatives.  It does not pursue additional outcome analysis of claimants following their claim nor does it look at the macro-economic impact of the initiatives.</p>

<section>
<h4 id="h2.08-h3.01-h4.01">3.1.1 Estimated EDB benefits paid</h4>
<p>Evaluation analysis found that claimants, on average, responded to the additional entitlement by increasing the number of weeks of regular EI benefits that they used.  The total benefits paid associated to the EDB includes not just the direct spending of the additional entitlement weeks that were used, but also the benefits of increased use of regular benefit weeks by claimants.  Consequently, the total benefits paid are accounted for by two separate estimates, as presented in Table 1.</p>

<p>Further analysis has shown that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Claimants who are 55 years and older remained on claim longer</li>
<li>Gender differences in EDB take-up rates were minimal</li>
<li>EDB take-up was greatest in British Columbia, Ontario and the Atlantic provinces</li>
</ul>
<p>The impact of a policy change on an individual’s action is referred to as a behavioural response.  A behavioural response due to a benefit extension can be captured by estimating the change in the usage of regular entitlement while controlling for other factors, not just by the usage of the additional 5 week entitlement.  Benefit usage can be influenced by the entitlement length as well as the economic conditions.  Since the EDB initiative was implemented during the recession, the evaluation can measure the change in benefit usage during the EDB period but cannot isolate the impact of the additional entitlement from the economic downturn.</p>
<p>Econometric analysis (ESDC, 2015) shows an increase of 1.6 weeks on average in the length of claims filed during the EDB period.  Furthermore, increased use of regular entitlement was observed among all claimants during the EDB period, not just among those who used additional weeks of benefits.</p>
<p>Based on previous studies on EI, the EDB can be expected to have affected claimants’ job search behavior and labour market outcomes through its effect on benefit use.  Krueger and Muller (2010) show that the generosity of EI benefits is inversely related to job search intensity.  Benefit use may increase when entitlement periods are extended, as claimants feel less pressure to secure re-employment.  At the same time, extensions to EI benefits may provide enhanced support for unemployed workers by allowing claimants to search more carefully for better reemployment, as suggested in Browning and Crossley (2009) and Bloemen and Stancanelli (2005), and consequently bring about improved quality of job match.  It was not possible to assess in this evaluation whether or not the additional benefit use helped employees realize a better job match resulting in greater productivity since no information (employment, income) was available on claimants’ post EDB experience.</p>

<section>
<h5>Benefit exhaustion</h5>
<p>To determine whether the EBD initiative provided adequate temporary income support to those looking for suitable employment, an analysis of entitlement exhaustion was conducted.  Econometric analysis (ESDC, 2015), controlling for several economic and demographic factors (see <a href="#tbl-12a">Table F.1 of Appendix F</a>), found that the probability of entitlement exhaustion decreased during the EDB period.  The study showed that claims during the EDB pilot encountered on average a 5.3 percentage point lower likelihood of entitlement exhaustion rate.  These findings indicate that the 34.4% of claimants who used additional entitlement under EDB (<a href="#tbl-02">Table 2</a>) would have been more likely to exhaust their entitlement in the absence of extended week initiatives.</p>

<p>One of the main conclusions of the evaluation of Pilot Projects Nos. 6 and 10 was that their cost was fairly high in relation to their policy objectives, primarily because the benefits provided reached a larger population than the main population they were supposed to reach: seasonal workers.<sup id="fn4-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn4"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>4</a></sup> Pilot 15 total benefits paid are presented in Table 3.</p>

<p class="mrgn-tp-md mrgn-bttm-xl">Table 3 presents estimated benefits paid of Pilot 15. The table comprises four columns and six rows. The first column (from the left to the right) lists the descriptive.  Estimated benefits are given per beneficiary (second row from the top), per claim (third row), annually (fourth row) and for the total (fifth row); Percentage calculated out of total additional benefits are provided in the sixth row.  The second column of table 3 provides estimated benefits paid due to additional entitlement and the third column the estimated benefits paid due to increased use of regular entitlement. Total estimated additional benefits are given in the fourth column. The fourth column is obtained by summing estimated benefits due to additional entitlement and those due to increased use of regular entitlement.</p>

<p>The estimated benefits paid due to additional entitlement for Pilot 15 was $326 million resulting in an average benefit of $1,432 per beneficiary.<sup id="fn5-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn5"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>5</a></sup> The benefits paid due to estimated increased use of entitlement during Pilot 15 was 42% ($233 million) of the total $558 million benefits of Pilot 15.  Therefore, for every dollar spent on providing additional benefits during Pilot 15, there was on average an additional 42 cents spent on providing benefits for regular entitlement.</p>
<p>The analysis on seasonal claims suggests that $17.8 million additional benefit was paid to the seasonal income gappers during Pilot 15, which is 3.2% of Pilot 15 total benefits paid.</p>

<h4 id="h2.08-h3.04-h4.02">3.2.2 Impact of additional entitlement on claimants' behaviour, in particular on seasonal claimants</h4>
<p>Similarly to the analysis presented for EDB, the impact of Pilot 15 on the benefit usage is discussed.  The descriptive analysis is presented for all claims in Pilot 15 regions and for claims for seasonal income gappers.  Results from econometric analysis after controlling for economic and demographic factors are provided as well.</p>

<h5>Benefits usage – All claims in pilot 15 regions</h5>
<p>Table 4 presents Pilot 15 results on the use of additional weeks.  During the Pilot period, 22,627 claims representing 29.6% of pure regular benefit claims from the pilot regions used some of the additional weeks, and 66% of these used the entire five weeks.</p>

<p>Further analysis has shown that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Claimants who are 55 years and older remained on claim longer</li>
<li>Pilot 15 take-up rates were higher among female claimants</li>
</ul>
<p>Econometric analysis (ESDC, 2015) shows that  claimants residing in the pilot regions during Pilot 15 period remained on  claim 1 week longer on average.</p>
<p>Pilot 15 decreased a claimant's likelihood of exhausting EI benefits by 6.4 percentage points on  average. These findings indicate that  the 29.6% of claimants who used additional entitlement under Pilot 15 (Table 4) would have been more likely to exhaust their entitlement in the absence of extended week initiatives.</p>

<h5>Benefits usage – Seasonal income gappers</h5>
<p>Since the objective of Pilot Project No. 15 was targeted to  seasonal gappers, an analysis focussing on this subset of EI claims was  conducted.  Table 5 presents key  characteristics of seasonal gappers, non-gappers and claimants in the  pilot regions during the Pilot 15 period, the findings are summarized below. </p>
<ul>
<li>The proportion of female claimants was higher among the seasonal gappers than the non-gappers.</li>
<li>Seasonal gappers are found to be older than non-gappers. Claimants who were 55 years and older represent 42.6% of the seasonal gappers compared to 30.5% of the seasonal non-gappers in pilot regions.</li>
<li>It is observed that 51% of the seasonal gappers were from Quebec region while 42.5% of non-gappers were from this region. </li>
<li>It is found that seasonal gappers had significantly a lesser amount of insured hours and earnings than the non-gappers. As a result, seasonal gappers had a lower benefit rate and fewer weeks of entitlement       than the non-gappers.</li>
<li>Notably, seasonal gappers remained on claim longer than the non-gappers despite having fewer entitlement weeks since they all used their entire entitlements and are entitlement exhaustees.</li>

<p class="mrgn-tp-md mrgn-bttm-xl">The columns of table 7 (from the left to the right) present the number of seasonal claims, the additional week take-up rate for seasonal claims, percentages of observed gappers and potential gappers among seasonal beneficiaries, and the percentage points reduction in the number of gappers as a result of Pilot 15. Percentage points reported for claimants who are not gappers anymore are obtained by subtracting the percentage of observed gappers among seasonal beneficiaries (third column) from the percentage of claimants who would have been gappers (fourth column).</p>

<p>Source: 10% sample of EI claims from the Status Vector file, restricted to completed pure regular claims with non-zero benefit filed during Pilot 15 period, excluding claims filed in the three regions impacted by the trigger provision; and those filed in Yukon, Nunavut, and the Northwest Territories.</p>

<h5>Controlling for economic and demographic factors </h5>
<p>Econometric analysis (ESDC, 2015) suggests that on average, the probability of income gap among the seasonal claims in pilot regions decreased by 3.3 percentage points due to Pilot 15 and that seasonal income gappers, who filed their claims from the pilot regions during the Pilot 15 period, had 2.2 weeks shorter income gap length on average. However, the claims associated with seasonal gappers during the Pilot 15 period represented only 4.6% of claimants that used extra weeks.</p>
<p>Accordingly, despite being broadly targeted, evaluation findings suggest that Pilot 15 was successful in reducing the incidence of income gaps among the seasonal claimants as well as shortening their income gap periods.</p>

<h4 id="h2.08-h3.04-h4.03">3.2.3 Impact of termination trigger in pilot 15</h4>
<p>Another feature that distinguishes Pilot 15 from EDB is the inclusion of an unemployment-based automatic termination trigger by which a region was to be excluded from the pilot when its unemployment rate was below 8% for 12 consecutive months.</p>
<p>Associations between the timing of termination trigger and the claim outcome measures of interest were studied to explore the impact of termination trigger on claimants' behaviour (ESDC, 2015).  The outcomes of claims that began just few weeks before the trigger are compared to outcomes of claims that began just a few weeks after the trigger by looking at the trigger-affected regions only.  A regression discontinuity analysis found that the termination trigger reduced the claim length by 5.3 weeks.  On the contrary, the timing of termination trigger does not have any significant effect on the entitlement exhaustion rate and regular entitlement usage rate.  These findings suggest that the termination trigger was successful in terms of its timing and design.</p>

<h2 id="h2.09">4. Conclusions</h2>
<p>The first objective of EDB was to provide extended financial support to EI claimants as a spending stimulus during the uncertainty of the 2008/2009 economic downturn.  Analysis of the benefits paid for EDB suggests that the initiative provided an estimated stimulus of 2.5 billion dollars between March 9, 2008 and September 11, 2010.  During the initiative, increased use was observed among all claimants, not just among those who used additional weeks of benefits.  Furthermore, the EDB initiative was successful in meeting its second objective of reducing the entitlement exhaustion rate by 5.3 percentage points.</p>
<p>Pilot 15 was implemented to allow testing of the effects of providing five extra benefit weeks through a period of economic recovery and to help workers who regularly experience an income gap after exhausting their EI entitlement, before finding subsequent employment.  Pilot 15 was successful in reducing the incidence of income gaps among the seasonal claimants; however, these claimants only represent a small proportion of all claimants who were impacted by the pilot.  The termination trigger of Pilot 15 was successful in terms of its timing and design. In regions affected by the trigger, claimants' exhaustion of benefits and number of weeks used were similar before and after the trigger.  Therefore, the termination trigger is to be considered in the future if extending entitlement based on the unemployment rate. </p>

<p class="mrgn-tp-md mrgn-bttm-xl">Table B.1 gives the entitlement weeks in non-pilot regions and for the no-extension period per range of hours of insurable employment and regional rate of unemployment. The table has 13 columns. The first column lists the range of hours of insurable employment starting from 420-454 hours to 1820 and above. The second to the thirteenth column give the range of regional rate of unemployment starting from 6% and under to more than 16%. Entitlement weeks vary from 14 to 45 weeks and increase with the number of insured hours and with the rate of unemployment. Cells are left blank if no entitlement week is available for a combination of a range of hours of insurable employment and an unemployment rate.</p>

<p class="mrgn-tp-md mrgn-bttm-xl">Table C.1 presents entitlement weeks in pilot regions per range of hours of insurable employment and regional rate of unemployment. The table has 13 columns. The first column lists the range of hours of insurable employment starting from 420-454 hours to 1820 and above. The second to the thirteenth column give the range of regional rate of unemployment starting from 6% and under to more than 16%. Entitlement weeks vary from 19 to 45 weeks and increase with the number of insured hours and with the rate of unemployment. Cells are left blank if no entitlement week is available for a combination of a range of hours of insurable employment and an unemployment rate.</p>

<h3 id="h2.16-h3.01">F.1 Lines of evidence</h3>
<p>A literature review was conducted to address questions related to the rationale of the EDB and Extension of EI Regular Benefits for Long-Tenured Workers (LTW) initiatives.  The full list of questions regarding EDB and Pilot 15 evaluation can be found in <a href="#h2.15">Appendix E – Evaluation Matrix</a>.</p>
<p>This evaluation report is primarily based on the technical study "Extended Duration of EI Regular Benefits: Evaluation Study 2014", which is a descriptive and econometric study of a sample of completed EI claims to which only regular benefits were paid.</p>
<p>Three previous technical updates to ESDC, 2015 were also submitted to support the annual EI Monitoring and Assessment Reports (MARs), which only examined the impact of EDB using EI administrative data.  But due to reporting and initiative, timelines were limited to claims completed at the time.</p>
</section>
<!-- END h3 -->
<section>
<h3 id="h2.16-h3.02">F.2 Data source and restrictions</h3>
<p>The administrative data used are from the Status Vector (SV) file, a derivative of the department's Benefits and Overpayments file which is used to administer EI claims, and the Record of Employment (ROE).</p>
<p>The SV includes information on claim applications, bi-weekly claimant reports, and EI Commission claim and benefits decisions.  The data used for this analysis is based on a 10 percent sample of completed EI claims starting from June 5, 2005 to March 9, 2013. Claims receiving regular benefits alone were retained in the sample.  Claims deemed to be LTW are excluded from the data sample when they received a larger entitlement than they would have under the EDB benefit schedule.   In addition, due to the retroactive nature of the EDB initiative, claimants who initiated a claim between March 9, 2008 and November 16, 2008 and who could have experienced a gap in their benefit periods were excluded from the sample (30% of claims during EDB time period).</p>
<p>The ROE is completed by an employer when an employee stops working for that employer and contains information on the employment history of an individual.  Only ROEs that were completed within 52 weeks after the end of the current claim have been considered.</p>

<h3 id="h2.16-h3.03">F.3 Definitions</h3>
<p>The study of extended week initiatives requires the use of terms and concepts that are not immediately obvious. The following are some of the key terminologies that are used throughout the report.</p>
<section>
<h4>Profile</h4>
<p><strong>Pure regular claims:</strong> A claim where only regular benefits were paid.  Other special benefits available through EI at the time include maternity, parental, sickness, and compassionate care leave benefits. Any claims with special benefits received are excluded from the sample.</p>
<p><strong>First-time claims:</strong> No regular claims in the 5 year prior to the current claim.</p>
<p><strong>Occasional claims:</strong> One or two regular claims in the 5 year prior to the current claim.</p>
<p><strong>Frequent claims:</strong> Three or more regular claims in the 5 year prior to the current claim.</p>
<p><strong>Seasonal claims:</strong> A subset of frequent claims i.e. those with 3 or more regular claims in the 5 years prior to current claim, all starting within the same eight week calendar period as the current claim.</p>
<p><strong>Entitlement exhaustees:</strong> Claims for which all weeks of regular entitlements are paid.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit period exhaustees:</strong> Claims that reach the final week of the benefit period before all regular benefits are paid.</p>
<p><strong>Gappers:</strong> Entitlement exhaustees who experienced an income gap longer than 1 week between the exhaustion of their regular claim and their first day of work following 52 weeks of the current claim.  An individual exhausting his or her claim on a Friday and starting a new job on the following Monday is considered to have a one week gap; this is due to the calculation of the week code variable in the administrative database.  In order to avoid erroneously assuming these individuals experienced an income gap, only those claimants with an income gap longer than one week were considered to be gappers.  Note that this study considers only seasonal gappers for impact analysis; accordingly gappers were extracted only to identify seasonal gappers.</p>
<p><strong>Seasonal gappers:</strong> Gappers who had 3 or more regular claims in the 5 years prior to current claim, all starting at the same eight week calendar period as the current claim.  The definitions of gapper and seasonal gapper are explained in Figure F2.</p>
<figure id="figF2">

<summary>Image description</summary>
<p class="mrgn-tp-md mrgn-bttm-xl">Figure 2 is a chart used to provide a definition of seasonal gappers (at the bottom of the chart). EI claims (at the top of the chart) are subdivided into pure regular claims and other EI claims. Pure regular claims are selected and subdivided into claims for which EI benefits were not exhausted and claims for which the benefits were exhausted. Only claims with exhausted benefits are relevant to identify gappers. These claims are classified into claims with an income gap of 1 week, claims with an income gap longer than 1 week within 52 weeks following the current claim and claims with an income gap surpasses 52 weeks following the current claim. Claims with an income gap longer than 1 week within 52 weeks following the current claim are gappers. Seasonnal gappers are gappers with 3 or more regular claims in the 5 years prior to current claim, all starting at the same eight week calendar period as the current claim.</p>

<h4>Outcome</h4>
<p><strong>Additional weeks take-up rate:</strong> Percentage of pure regular benefit  claimants who had used some of the extra weeks.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit use:</strong> Number of weeks of non-zero regular EI benefits paid to a claimant.</p>
<p><strong>Entitlement exhaustion rate: </strong> Percentage of pure regular benefit claims  for which all weeks of regular entitlements are paid.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit period exhaustion rate: </strong> Percentage of pure regular benefit claims  for which the benefit period ends before the regular weeks of entitlement are  paid.</p>
<p><strong>Rate of occurrence of seasonal gap:</strong> Percentage of seasonal gappers among the  seasonal claims.</p>
<p><strong>Regular entitlement usage rate:</strong> This rate refers to the percentage of weeks  of regular EI benefits paid over the number of weeks of regular entitlement  (without benefit extension) capped at 100%.   Technically, this percentage can be more than 100% for a number of  claimants who collected extra weeks under any initiative that provides extended  weeks of benefits.  If no extended  benefit weeks would have been available, these claimants would have collected  all of their regular entitlement weeks and their regular entitlement usage would  have been 100%.  This variable is a  measure of relative usage of benefit weeks, where a higher rate indicates  greater usage of regular entitlement and a lower rate indicates more  entitlement than required.</p>
<p><strong>Gap length:</strong> Number of weeks of income gap experienced by  gappers.</p>
<p><strong>Additional entitlement cost:</strong>This cost is obtained by only counting the additional weeks received by the claimants.   These cost estimates accurately reflects the costs of extended weeks of  benefits paid to claimants; however, it does not reflect all costs of the  measure.</p>
<p><strong>Cost related to the extended use of the regular entitlement:</strong> This  estimate incorporates a cost related to the extended use of the regular  entitlement into the calculations.  The  change in the number of benefit weeks used accounts for several labour market factors  that influence the number of benefit weeks a person receives.  This estimate reflects the cost related to  the number of benefit weeks that are directly attributable to the  implementation of the extended benefit initiatives.</p>

<h3 id="h2.16-h3.04">F.4 Methodology</h3>
<p>Groups of claims were selected prior to, during and after the EDB period from regions included in the extended weeks pilots (pilot regions) and those that were not (non-pilot regions). To assess the impact of the initiatives, the sequence of events is divided into four different time periods in order to control for the large changes in the economic environment.  Table F.1 presents the sequence of events for these two groups.</p>

<p class="mrgn-tp-md">Table F.1 is divided into two sections. The first section lists the start and end date of the initiative periods for Pilot 6, Pilot 10, Pilot 10 and EDB Retroactivity, EDB, Pilot 15 and the no-extension period. The EDB retroactive start date was March 9th, 2008 and the end date was February 28th, 2009. The Pilot 15 start date was September 12, 2010 and the end date was September 15, 2012.</p>
<p class="mrgn-bttm-xl">The second section of Table 1 includes the start and end dates of the analysis period as well as a breakdown in the final two rows as to whether the Pilot region and non-pilot regions experienced extended entitlement or normal entitlement. For the EDB analysis period, the start date was November 16, 2008 and the end date was September 11, 2010. Both the pilot and non-pilot regions had extended entitlement. For the Pilot 15 analysis period, the start date was September 12, 2010 and the end date was September 15, 2012. The pilot region had extended entitlement and the non-pilot region had normal entitlement.</p>

<p>Descriptive results on EI benefit weeks and the proportion of the extra entitlements used are obtained by claim and claimant characteristics.  A linear model is adopted to analyze benefit duration changes and a logit model is used for probability of exhaustions (ESDC, 2015). The following table lists the covariates in the regression model.</p>

<p>Difference-in-difference regression methods (Wooldridge, 2010) are applied to measure the impact of the extended week initiatives. Difference-in-difference regression methods are applied over the four periods (Pilot 6 and 10, EDB, Pilot 15 and No-extension) to evaluate the impact of the extended week initiatives. The method compares the average change in EI outcomes in pilot regions with non-pilot regions before and after the policy change. In addition, a regression discontinuity design (Imbens and Lemieux, 2008) has been applied to evaluate the impact of the termination trigger in Pilot 15.  A comprehensive discussion on these methodologies as well as detailed econometric results can be found in the study titled Extended Duration of EI Regular Benefits: Evaluation Technical Study (ESDC, 2015).</p>

<p>According to EI Monitoring and Assessment Report 2012, a total of 1,299,460 claimants had received $1.92 billion in additional benefits as a result of EDB.  The difference between accounting cost and the estimated cost is because of the sample restrictions.  The current analysis is based on a sample of pure regular claims i.e. completed EI claims to which only regular benefits were paid.  Claimants deemed to be LTW are also excluded from the cost estimation.</p>
