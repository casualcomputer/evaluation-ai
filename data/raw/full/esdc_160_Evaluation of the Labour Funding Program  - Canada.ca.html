<h2 id="h2-1">Executive  summary</h2>
<p>This interim report  presents findings from the evaluation of two streams of the Labour Funding  Program (LFP): International Trade and Labour (ITL) and Occupational Health and  Safety grants code (OHS-G). The evaluation covers the period from April 2012 to  March 2016 and focuses on the extent to which the projects funded through the  program’s grants align with stakeholders’ needs, achieve project-specific  outputs and immediate outcomes, and contribute to the program’s expected  outcomes. Preliminary results from a review of ITL documents and project files  demonstrate that the grants are producing most, if not all, of their expected  outputs and are generally achieving their immediate outcomes. Final results are  presented for OHS-G, based on a document and file review and key informant  interviews. OHS-G projects are also generally producing their expected outputs  and immediate outcomes. </p>
<p>The Labour Funding  Program is expected to contribute to safe, fair and productive workplaces and  cooperative workplace relations in Canada and internationally. Specifically,  the International Trade and Labour stream is expected to help Canada meet its  commitments under international labour agreements and to assist Canada’s  partner countries to meet internationally-recognized labour rights and  principles. The Occupational Health and Safety-G stream is expected to help  build knowledge and capacity to address occupational health and safety issues  and to harmonize standards across Canada. The average annual grant spending of  the program, from 2011 to 2012 through 2015 to 2016, was about $1.25 million  for ITL and $64,250 for OHS-G. </p>
<p>This evaluation is  being completed in accordance with requirements in the <strong>Financial Administration Act</strong>,  which stipulates that this assessment is to be completed by April 2017.  Additional results on the International Trade and Labour stream’s role in  supporting Canada’s Labour Provisions of Free Trade Agreements will be  presented in a more comprehensive evaluation of Bilateral and Regional Labour  Affairs in spring 2017.   </p>
<section>
<h3>Preliminary findings, International  Trade and Labour stream </h3>
<p>Seventeen projects  have been funded between April 2012 and March 2016. In terms of relevance, the  grants are generally well aligned with the priorities and expected outcomes of  the program and the overall department, as well as international labour  standards, rights and principles. The grants also continue to be relevant to  the needs of partner countries. Sixteen of the seventeen grants funded  capacity-building activities to help partner countries with specific labour-related  issues, and all were aligned with at least one international labour right or  principle. One project funded research on international labour agreements,  which is relevant to the stream’s outcomes. </p>
<p>Regarding performance,  all eleven projects completed by December 2016 achieved most or all expected  outputs, and outcomes. In the medium- to long-run, all completed projects are  reported to have established conditions that could lead to improvements in  partner countries’ labour situations, but as is common with development  projects, it is difficult to attribute broad impacts directly back to such  small grants. The scope and expected outcomes of the projects sometimes evolve  due to changing context or difficulties engaging stakeholders in partner  countries. Tracking the evolution of expected and achieved outcomes by projects  is something of a challenge because the program lacks a database to  systematically gather project updates and results in one place. Outcome  sustainability is a challenge for technical assistance projects in general;  however, six of eleven completed projects have reported or demonstrated a  strong likelihood for sustainable results, and the other five reported  producing at least one project component that is likely to be sustainable. </p>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Findings, Occupational Health and  Safety stream</h3>
<p>Two projects were  provided with funding through this stream between April 2012 and March 2016.  Evidence gathered from program documents and key informant interviews  ‎demonstrates the grants have delivered or are delivering on expected results. As  of the 2014 to 2015 fiscal year, the first project had contributed to building  and sharing knowledge and harmonizing occupational health and safety standards  by producing twelve standards through a development process involving multiple  stakeholders, including the provinces and territories. Six of these labour  standards were also published on a website administered by the recipient. The  remaining standards are expected to be published by 2019. The other grant  provided funds for a research project.The project built knowledge on the  different factors that should be considered to increase health and safety for  all new workers and young workers in particular. This information was shared  with representatives from federally-regulated employee and employer groups in  high risk industries (for example transport, communications, and shipping).</p>

<h2 id="h2-2">1.0  Introduction</h2>
<p>In April 2012, all  grants and contributions of the Labour Program were integrated under one set of  terms and conditions into a single program: the Labour Funding Program (LFP). The  program is a mechanism for the Government of Canada to meet its commitments to  address domestic and international labour issues in the context of trade and  globalization<sup id="fn1-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn1"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>1</a></sup>. Ultimately, the program is expected to  contribute to safe, fair and productive workplaces and cooperative workplace  relations in Canada and internationally (see <a href="#h2-4">Annex 1</a>  for the program’s logic model). </p>
<p>This report presents  the findings from the evaluation of two of the program’s funding streams:  International Trade and Labour (ITL) and Occupational Health and Safety Grants  (OHS-G). It fulfills the requirement to review the relevance and performance of  the program, focusing on the seventeen ITL grants and two OHS grants disbursed  from the program’s inception in April 2012 through March 2016. In accordance  with the low dollar value of the program<sup id="fn2-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn2"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>2</a></sup>, the evaluation team focused on the relevance  of the grant-funded projects to program, department and government priorities;  the alignment between projects, expected outcomes of the funding streams, and  responsibilities of the parent programs<sup id="fn3-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn3"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>3</a></sup>; and the achievement of project-specific  outputs and outcomes. Attempts were made to assess medium- and long-run impacts  of the ITL stream to the extent possible; however, the grants were too small to  determine with certainty their contributions to Canada’s competitiveness on the  international stage or to the overall labour situations of partner countries.  The report presents preliminary findings based on a review of program documents  and project files. Final results will be part of the evaluation of the  Bilateral and Regional Labour Affairs program to be completed in spring 2017. </p>
<p>OHS-G, as a smaller  stream, was evaluated based on the achievement of project activities, outputs,  and immediate outcomes. The report presents final results from both a document  and file review, and key informant interviews. </p>

<h3 id="h3-1">1.1  Labour Funding Program background</h3>
<p>The Labour Funding  Program (LFP) is a grants and contributions program created to centralize the  management of all the Labour Program’s grants and contributions under a single  set of terms and conditions. Originally, the program had three funding streams:  the Labour-Management Partnerships, International Trade and Labour (ITL), and  Occupational Health and Safety and Fire Prevention<sup id="fn4-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn4"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>4</a></sup>. However, the Labour-Management Partnerships  stream and the Fire Prevention Grants were defunded soon after the creation of  the program. In 2014 to 2015, the Employment Equity Program introduced the Workplace  Opportunities: Removing Barriers to Equity stream<sup id="fn5-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn5"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>5</a></sup>. The new stream will be evaluated with its  parent program, leaving two streams to be covered in this evaluation. Expected  outcomes differ by stream, but both are intended to contribute to safe, fair,  and productive workplaces and cooperative workplace relations in Canada and  internationally. <a href="#h2-4">Annex 1</a> presents the program’s  logic model. </p>
<section>
<h4 id="h4-1">International Trade and  Labour stream (ITL)</h4>
<p>Grants and  contributions to support the negotiation and implementation of trade-related  labour agreements initially constituted one stream of the International Trade  and Labour Program, which was created in 2004 to 2005. As the Labour Program  moved to centralize the management of all its grants and contributions, the  International Trade and Labour Program was scaled down, and the remaining  grants were then integrated within the Labour Funding Program as the  International Trade and Labour stream. From 2012 to 2013, to 2015 to 2016, the  average annual budget for the stream was $1,253,291<sup id="fn6-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn6"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>6</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Bilateral and Regional  Labour Affairs is responsible for negotiating and monitoring the Labour  Provisions of Free Trade Agreements. As part of its work, it uses the grants to  either facilitate negotiations, or to help Canada’s partners comply with the  commitments made under Labour Cooperation Agreements or Labour Chapters of Free  Trade Agreements. These agreements include a section that specifies the modes  and areas for technical cooperation between the parties. These sections  regulate the kind of projects that can be supported and, therefore, determine  the type of technical assistance the grants fund. Bilateral and Regional Labour  Affairs was responsible for fourteen grants as of March 2016. The other three  grants fell under the responsibility of Multilateral Labour Affairs, which used  the grants to fund cooperative labour activities under two labour-related  Memoranda of Understanding with China. </p>
</section>
<section>
<h4 id="h4-2">Occupational Health and  Safety Stream (OHS-G)</h4>
<p>The Occupational  Health and Safety stream is intended to contribute to the federal workplace  health and safety objectives, which are linked to the purpose of the <strong>Canada Labour Code</strong> (Part II). Two annual grants were originally approved in 1959 and modified in  1986: the Occupational Health and Safety grant ($15,000), and the Standards  Writing Organization grant ($12,000). These grants were not adjusted for  inflation. Upon the inception of the Labour Funding Program in April 2012, the  Terms and Conditions for the occupational health and safety-related grants were  replaced with the new Labour Funding Program Terms and Conditions, and the two  grants ceased to exist under their previous names. Starting in 2013 to 2014,  the Canadian Standards Association signed an agreement with Employment and  Social Development Canada (ESDC) to receive grants for a five year period  ($135,000 in total). The grants were to support the organization’s ongoing  projects to share knowledge and to harmonize occupational health and safety  systems across Canadian jurisdictions. It is important to note, though, that  ESDC’s contribution to the projects only constitutes a small part of their  total funding (about 8.6% from March 2013 to March 2018). Final results from  the five-year agreement are not yet available because the project is ongoing. </p>
<p>In addition to these  long-standing grants, the stream’s budget for 2015 to 2016 included a one-time  only grant in the amount of $174,102 to support a collaborative project  undertaken by Parachute Leaders in Injury Prevention. The goal of this project  was to identify and address occupational health and safety issues specific to  young workers. The one-time only agreement with Parachute Leaders provided  research on factors that could lead to accidents and illnesses. The present  evaluation examined the outputs of this project.</p>

<h2 id="h2-3">2.0  Findings</h2>
<p>Findings  are presented in two parts (one for each stream) and according to the  evaluation questions approved by the Departmental Evaluation Committee (now the  Performance Measurement and Evaluation Committee) in December 2015.</p>
<section>
<h3 id="h3-2">2.1  International  Trade and Labour stream </h3>
<p><strong>Are International Trade and Labour projects aligned  with government priorities related to the maintenance of international labour  rights and principles?</strong></p>
<p>Individual project  approvals and planning documents for all projects demonstrate alignment between  the projects’ expected results, expected outcomes, and ESDC’s mandate. The  International Trade and Labour stream supports the Labour Program’s priority to  provide technical assistance to countries with which Canada has negotiated or  is negotiating a labour agreement, as well as broader government priorities for  international relations and trade, including the progressive trade agenda. </p>
<p>In order of priority,  projects are funded, first, in partner countries; second, in countries with  active or concluded negotiations; and third, in countries of national interest  or importance. Sixteen projects have contributed to Canada meeting its  commitments under its agreements with partner countries, as demonstrated in <a href="#h2-5">Annex 2</a>. Eight projects supported technical assistance  projects in countries with existing agreements; four projects were undertaken  in countries with which negotiations were active or had concluded<sup id="fn7-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn7"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>7</a></sup>; and one project had activities in two  countries, one of which already had an agreement in place with Canada (the  other had recently concluded negotiations). The other three projects supported  cooperative activities with China. The only project that did not fulfill a  specific commitment to a partner country was a research project on the  effectiveness of labour agreements conducted by the International Labour  Organization. </p>
<p>Each of the sixteen  country-specific projects pursued outcomes that aligned with the International  Labour Organization's international labour standards and with the Decent Work  agenda. Of those, fourteen projects included outcomes that aligned with the  organization’s 1998 <strong>Declaration  on Fundamental Rights and Principles at Work</strong> and three were  also part of the organization’s Better Work program. This evidence indicates  that projects are generally well aligned with government priorities related to  the maintenance of internationally-recognized labour rights and principles. </p>
<p><strong>Did the projects funded through the International  Trade and Labour stream deliver the expected project results?</strong></p>
<p>Out of seventeen  projects, six have made strong progress toward achieving not just some, but all  outcomes. ESDC’s 2016 to 2017 <strong>Report  on Plans and Priorities </strong>defines International Trade and Labour  project success as 85% of project objectives met in full or in part. All eleven  projects completed as of December 2016 delivered partial or full results and,  overall, meet this definition of success. Similarly, four of six ongoing  projects are reported to have already achieved or are on track to implement  activities, outputs and outcomes. Reports for the other two projects note that  the projects have been facing delays. Based on reports by implementation  agencies, major challenges to project implementation such as incomplete  activities, outputs, outcomes or objectives often result from a lack of  engagement with key stakeholders and/or a changing political context. </p>
<p><strong>To what extent has the International Trade and Labour  stream supported Canada's partners in addressing labour-related issues?</strong></p>
<p>Projects usually  support capacity building activities to address labour issues and/or  improvements in labour legislation and policies, so that partners can fulfill  their commitments under their agreements with Canada<sup id="fn8-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn8"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>8</a></sup>. In general, these projects respond to partner  countries’ labour-related needs. The labour conditions and technical assistance  needs of partner countries are always articulated in project approval documents  and funding arrangements based on research, discussions, and, when possible,  meetings with partner countries. However, the process to assess partners’ needs  is not always clearly articulated in the project files. In 2015, Bilateral and  Regional Labour Affairs undertook a pilot project to produce compliance reports  for five partner countries. These compliance reports highlight labour-related  areas of need for technical assistance in partner countries, which can be used  as formal needs assessments for technical assistance through the Labour Funding  Program. </p>
<p>Direct consultation  exchanges were documented between Canada and partner countries for ten of  seventeen projects. Some program and project files also reference more informal  exchanges about technical assistance needs during bilateral meetings, missions  to partner countries, and meetings of multilateral labour forums such as the  International Labour Organization<sup id="fn9-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn9"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>9</a></sup>. </p>
<p>Approval documents  also sometimes note linkages to previous projects, describing how the new  project aligns with and/or leverages completed and ongoing labour technical  assistance. The extent of coordination between donors is sometimes articulated  in project files or implicit in the project design (for example, projects  funded through large technical assistance frameworks such as the Better Work  Vietnam program), but this type of coordination is not clearly documented for  every project. Coordination with other donors has increased in recent years  through such means as visits to fellow donor countries for the purpose of  coordination and meetings with representatives from other donor countries  during missions to beneficiary countries. Project implementation agencies also  undertake some of the coordination work between beneficiary countries and  donors and between various donors. </p>
<p>Except for one  research project, the projects were designed to support some form of capacity  building in partner countries. This encompassed activities such as training of  inspectors, knowledge sharing, and development of inspections tools. The  activities vary according to the stakeholders groups involved (in other words  employers, employees, and government officials) and the specific labour  standards to be addressed (occupational health and safety, child labour,  protection of migrant workers, etc.). Progress reports and final reports for  the eleven projects completed by December 2016 indicate that ten of the  projects had made significant progress toward completing capacity-building  activities and outputs. The remaining project, which covered two countries,  completed capacity-building activities in one beneficiary country, but had less  success in the other. Most activities were undertaken in the second country,  but changing political priorities in the partner country posed a challenge to  full implementation of all activities. </p>
<p>In addition to  capacity building, four of the eleven completed projects also incorporated  activities to help partner countries maintain or improve their labour  legislation and policies. Progress was made on legislative and/or policy  changes in three of those projects. The fourth responded to a specific request  by the partner country, but received insufficient political and bureaucratic  support from the partner during implementation to achieve any legislative or  policy changes. </p>
<p>Time-only extensions  had been granted to eight of seventeen projects as of January 2017. These  extensions have helped projects complete their intended activities (or add  activities) when there were delays in obtaining approvals in partner countries,  key domestic stakeholders were not engaged (for instance, due to changing  political conditions), or activities proved more difficult to complete than  expected. Although documents and files suggest that completed projects have had  a positive effect on specific labour issues in partner countries, the  sustainability of project results is not always clear. Measurability of  long-term impacts and sustainability of results are common issues with  development funding and technical assistance projects for a number of reasons,  including changing political situations and ministerial priorities in partner  countries. Approval documents for ten projects explicitly discussed potential  sustainability of project activities and outcomes. There is no evidence of data  collection to measure medium- to long-run project effects past the final  progress report provided by the implementation agency, which is usually  provided six months post-project. </p>
<p>For evaluation  purposes, project sustainability was considered based on project progress and  final reports. Of eleven projects completed by December 2016, six had reported  strong likelihood of sustainability in most project components. The other five  were reported to have set conditions for sustainability in at least component,  but noted potential areas of concern regarding the sustainability of other  aspects of the project. </p>
<p><strong>To what extent has the International Trade and Labour  stream allowed Canada to fulfill its obligations under international labour  agreements?<a name="_Toc334774730"></a></strong></p>
<p>The stream has allowed Canada to fulfill its  commitments to partner countries by funding technical assistance projects in  eight partner countries since April 2012. The projects are an avenue for Canada  to support the mission and goals of international organizations and some grants  have funded specific projects implemented by the International Labour  Organization. Still, none of the projects directly support the general  operations of international labour-related forums or organizations. </p>
<p><strong>Are there more  efficient ways of achieving the expected outcomes? </strong></p>
<p>This particular stream is relatively small  compared with other labour-related technical assistance programs (for example,  the United Sates Department of Labour’s technical assistance fund; the  International Program for Professional Labour Administration, which was a  temporary initiative funded jointly by Global Affairs Canada and the Labour  Program). The equivalent of less than one Labour Program FTE is used per year  on the projects. Direct program spending is low compared to the grant amounts  disbursed (please see <a href="#h2-6">Annex 3</a> for financial  information). The stream has used its maximum grant amount every year since it  began. To help ensure efficiency and responsible use of funds, implementation  agencies selected to deliver the projects have to meet certain criteria for  labour expertise, financial administration, reporting on results, and field  presence. Any funds unused at the end of a project implemented by the  International Labour Organization in particular can be held by the  implementation agency for use in future projects funded by Canada, with  Canada’s agreement. Of twelve projects implemented by this organization, two  were partially financed by unused funds from previous grants. </p>
<p>Lessons learned from completed projects are  identified in briefing notes on an ad hoc basis and in project close out  reports. Most progress and final reports include lessons learned for the same  or future projects. At the stream level, program officials have adopted a best  practice to solicit projects rather than issuing regular calls for proposals,  in an effort to ensure projects are aligned with the stream’s objectives. One  grant was provided to the International Labour Organization’s research division  for a project that investigated the design, implementation, and impacts of  international labour agreements in general. This project contributed to  improving international understanding of labour agreements and technical  assistance, yielding multiple papers and conferences, as well as a final  research report. </p>
<p>In regards to program monitoring and  performance measurement to improve efficiency, useful data is available in the  project reports, site visit and mission reports, and informal status updates  regarding project alignment with expected International Trade and Labour stream  outcomes and individual project achievements. Sometimes, the outputs and  outcomes of the projects do not always match across different reporting  documents as projects evolve over time. The lack of a formal performance  information database limits the ability to extract, organize, and measure  performance data from project reports against the International Trade and  Labour performance measurement framework and to report on program-level  results. Program financial data indicates a low level of resources (less than  one FTE) to administer the program. </p>
<p>Officials do, however, monitor project progress  on an ongoing basis, either through formal or informal mechanisms. Evidence of  formal and/or informal monitoring by program officials was available for all  projects. These monitoring activities have allowed the program to provide  guidance and, if necessary, correct course throughout the life of the projects.  For some projects, this allowed the implementing agency to focus on delivering  some key intended results, or to shift to delivering alternative results that  still fit within the project scope and objectives. </p>
<p>Regarding formal monitoring, each funding  arrangement requires the project implementation agency to submit project  performance measurement and implementation plans shortly after the project  begins, followed by periodic progress reports on set dates or intervals and  final reports within six months of the project’s completion. For sixteen of the  projects, all expected progress reports have been provided. The remaining  project has not yet provided its expected formal progress reports; however,  briefing notes have been provided with short updates about delays. Final  reports expected to have been produced by the implementation agencies upon  project completion are available for all projects completed by March 2016.  Regarding more informal monitoring, the program collects information through  email and telephone updates, as well as through occasional site visits when  program officials participate in missions to partner countries. </p>
<p>In fall 2016, program officials began preparing  analyses of project progress reports sent by implementation agencies. These  analyses align better with the project reports than the standard grants and  contributions monitoring templates. They summarize the project reports from a  critical perspective against the project’s own performance indicators and  expected outcomes, and provide space for the analyst to reflect on follow up  questions and issues for further monitoring. </p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>This report presents initial findings on the  relevance and performance of the International Trade and Labour stream, based  on a review of program documents and project files. Additional findings from  key informant interviews will be incorporated in a final report, to be  presented with the findings of the Bilateral and Regional Labour Affairs  evaluation. The stream continues to be relevant to government and departmental  priorities and contributes to the implementation of Canada’s international  labour agreements. The projects respond to demonstrated needs of partner  countries and are generally having a positive effect on the trade-related  labour issues they are intended to address. All projects contribute to the  stream’s expected outcomes, and all completed projects have achieved  partial-to-full results on project-specific activities, outputs and outcomes.  The stream does, however, lack a database of project performance information.  Measuring long-term impacts and the sustainability of project results are challenges  faced by all development and technical assistance programs, including this one.  In the absence of long-term performance data from the projects, a database that  tracks the expected and completed results of each project could help paint the  picture of the stream’s contributions over time and the progress made across  projects within each country. </p>

<section>
<h3 id="h3-3">2.2 Occupational  Health and Safety Stream (OHS-G) </h3>
<p><strong>Did the projects funded through the Occupational  Health and Safety-Grants deliver the expected projects results?</strong></p>
<p>Although the funding  agreement with the Canadian Standards Association continues until March 2018,  the interview and document review suggests that the projects are on track to  achieve the expected activities and short-term outcomes. As per their funding  agreement, the Canadian Standards Association developed and maintained  Occupational Health and Safety standards covering such topics as ergonomics,  management systems, elevating work platforms, and protective headwear/footwear.  In addition, the Canadian Standards Association supported the accessibility of  standards through the View Access website which allows users to view Canadian  Standards Association Occupational Health and Safety standards online at no  cost. </p>
<p>As of February  20, 2015, ten of the twelve labour standards projects identified in the 2012 to  2014 Work Plan had been completed and made available for public review. Five of  the completed projects had been published on the View Access website and it was  expected that the remaining labour standards would be published by summer 2016. Moreover,  of the sixteen labour standards projects identified in the 2014 to 2016 Work  Plan, two had been completed and one had been published. The remaining projects  are expected to be published by 2019. </p>
<p>The goal of the “Young  Workers’ Injury Prevention Interventions in Canada” project was to develop  appropriate metrics for evaluating youth injury prevention initiatives, and to  present an evidence-based strategy to leverage these metrics for optimal use  and effectiveness. The project produced an analysis of the factors that may  impact youth injuries in workplaces (in other words environment, training and  experience), an environmental scan of youth injury prevention strategies, and a  literature review of metrics that could be used to measure youth injury  prevention strategies. </p>
<p><strong>Has the Occupation Health and Safety-Grants stream  contributed to the building and sharing of knowledge on the provisions of  employees' accidents and illnesses?</strong></p>
<p>The program has  contributed to the building and sharing of knowledge on the provisions of  employee’s accidents and illness through the Canadian Standards Association  standards development process. According to key informants, the process allows  professional workers from various backgrounds to be part of the advisory  committee and to participate in the publishing standards process. There is a  public review period before it is published that allows stakeholders to provide  input as the standards are developed.   The funding was also used to support the View Access Project, which  allows users such as workers and employers to view occupational health and  safety standards online at no cost. There is also a public forum called  Community, which is a platform for standard-based discussion that includes a specific  section on Occupational Health and Safety.<strong></strong></p>
<p>The young workers  project provided research on what factors could lead to accident and illness,  and it found that those same factors can contribute to safety, security, and  wellness in the work place. This research was also found to apply to new  immigrants in Canada and all new workers. It was mentioned in the key informant  interviews that the young workers’ prevention project was shared with members  of an Occupational Health and Safety advisory committee with representatives  from federally-regulated employee and employer groups in high risk industries (for  example transport, communications, and shipping). The committee was asked to  share this information widely with their groups so they could reach as many  employees and employers as possible. </p>
<p><strong>To what extent has the Occupational Health and  Safety-Grants stream contributed to the harmonization of occupational health  and safety standards across jurisdictions within Canada?</strong></p>
<p>The Canadian Standards  Association project has contributed to the harmonization of occupational health  and safety standards across jurisdictions within Canada through the use of a  committee with members from the national, provincial, and territorial  governments and regulators, as well as groups from various sectors that creates  and reviews the standards. The committee is structured and governed in order to  harmonize and ensure that the standards they develop are relevant and  applicable to the various occupational health and safety jurisdictions across  the country. </p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Although the  evaluation could not assess the medium and long term impacts of the projects,  evidence gathered from program documents as well as key informant interviews shows that the grants have delivered, or are in the process of delivering,  their expected results. </p>
<p>By the end of fiscal  year 2014 to 2015, the Canadian Standards Association project had contributed  to the building and sharing of knowledge and the harmonization of occupational  health and safety standards by completing twelve standards through a  development process involving multiple stakeholders, including the provinces  and territories. Six of these labour standards were also published on the  association’s View Access website. It is expected that the remaining labour  standards will be published by 2019. </p>
<p>The grant for young  workers has built knowledge on the different factors that should be considered  to increase health and safety not only for young workers but for all new  workers. This information was shared with representatives from federally-regulated  employee and employer groups in high risk industries (for example transport,  communications, and shipping).</p>

<h2 id="h2-4">Annex 1 - The Labour Funding Program  logic model </h2>
<p><img src="/content/dam/canada/employment-social-development/corporate/reports/evaluations/labour-funding-program/annex-1.jpg"/></p>
<details>
<summary>Image  description</summary>
<p>Annex 1 presents the  Labour Funding Program’s logic model, which outlines the program’s activities,  its expected outputs, and the outcomes it intends to achieve or to which it  intends to contribute. The logic model covers all three funding streams that existed  at the program’s launch: international trade and labour, labour management  partnerships, and occupational health and safety and fire prevention. </p>
<p><strong>Activities</strong>  </p>
<p>The logic model  organizes the program activities into two groups based on the party responsible  for a given activity:</p>
<ol>
<li>Recipients:  Activities that support the labour dimension of globalization or support  labour-management dialogue or support occupational health and safety and fire  prevention.</li>
<li>Departmental:  Application and assessment; where applicable, establishing and implementing a  review committee; approval; agreement development; payments; financial and  performance monitoring and reporting; amendments; and close-out.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Outputs</strong></p>
<p>The two groups of  activities are intended to produce the following three outputs:</p>
<ol>
<li>Planning and reporting</li>
<li>Tools and information</li>
<li>Signed funding agreements</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Immediate outcomes</strong></p>
<p>The three outputs are  intended to produce four immediate outcomes:</p>
<ol>
<li>International  Trade and Labour Stream: Social dialogue occurs to address labour issues,  including labour issues related to labour cooperation agreements. </li>
<li>International  Trade and Labour Stream: Capacity developed to address labour issues, including  labour issues related to labour cooperation agreements. This outcome is also  expected to contribute to immediate outcome 1.</li>
<li>Labour  Management Partnerships Stream: Knowledge developed on the capacity of dispute  resolution to address labour management issues.</li>
<li>Occupational  Health and Safety and Fire Prevention Stream: Contributes to the building and  sharing of knowledge on prevention of accidents and illness for workers as well  as fire protection, fire prevention and safety.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Intermediate outcomes</strong></p>
<p>The four immediate  outcomes contribute to three intermediate outcomes. Each immediate outcome is  expected to contribute to the intermediate outcome of the same funding stream.</p>
<ol>
<li>International  Trade and Labour: Labour issues, including issues related to labour cooperation  agreements, are being addressed</li>
<li>Labour  Management Partnerships: Dispute resolution used to address labour management  issues</li>
<li>Occupational  Health and Safety and Fire Prevention: The new and updated knowledge is  expected to increase capacity to address occupational health and safety as well  as fire protection and fire prevention issues. The knowledge developed is also  expected to support the harmonization of occupational health and safety and  fire protection/prevention standards across jurisdictions through collaboration  and cooperation. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Ultimate outcomes</strong></p>
<p>The three intermediate  outcomes contribute to three ultimate outcomes. Each intermediate outcome is  expected to contribute to the ultimate outcome of the same funding stream.</p>
<ol>
<li>International  Trade and Labour: Contributes to increased partner countries’ enforcement of  internationally accepted labour legislation.</li>
<li>Labour  Management Partnerships: Contributes to reduced labour disruption.</li>
<li>Occupational  Health and Safety and Fire Prevention: The capacity to address occupational  health and safety and fire protection and fire prevention issues, as well as  the development, updating and harmonization of occupational health and safety  and fire protection/prevention standards and practices will contribute to a  reduction in work-related accidents and illnesses and injury and death due to  fire. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Strategic Outcome</strong></p>
<p>The Labour Funding  Program aligns with one strategic outcome: Safe, fair and productive workplaces  and cooperative workplace relations in Canada and internationally.</p>

<p>In a  situation where a concluded agreement was at risk of not being ratified,  Bilateral and Regional Labour Affairs entered into a labour cooperation  framework with one of the partner countries involved in the negotiations. The  framework outlined labour-related issues that could be addressed through  cooperative activities, including labour-related technical assistance projects.  The framework was signed in the same month as an project was approved with the  partner country.</p>
