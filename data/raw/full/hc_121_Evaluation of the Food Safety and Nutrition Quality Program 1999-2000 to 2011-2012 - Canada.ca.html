<h2 id="ex">Executive Summary</h2>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>This evaluation covered the Food Safety and Nutrition Quality Program (FSNQP) for the period from 1999 to 2012. The evaluation was undertaken in fulfillment of the requirements of the Treasury Board of Canada's <em>Policy on Evaluation (2009)</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<h3>Evaluation Purpose and Scope</h3>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>The purpose of the evaluation was to assess the relevance and performance of the FSNQP. The evaluation was also designed to highlight accomplishments and lessons learned as well as challenges experienced by the Program.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>The evaluation covers all of the activities of Health Canada's Food Directorate (FD), the Bureau of Food Safety Assessment, and regional offices and laboratories as well as the incrementally funded activities of the First Nations and Inuit Health Branch, the Pest Management Regulatory Agency (PMRA) and the Public Health Agency of Canada, namely nutrition and food security related activities, surveillance and risk analysis pertaining to the chemical safety of traditional foods, and health promotion activities focussed on the prevention of enteric disease outbreaks in First Nations communities; the re-evaluation of technical active ingredients as well as active ingredients in end-use products registered prior to December 31<sup>st</sup>, 1994; and, enteric disease surveillance, targeted investigations, laboratory services, information management of food safety issues, and foodborne illness outbreak investigation and response. The evaluation does not cover activities associated with the Biotechnology, Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy and Healthy Living initiatives, the activities of Health Canada's Office of Nutrition Policy and Promotion and the Veterinary Drugs Directorate, and enforcement and compliance activities carried out by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA).</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<h3>Program Description</h3>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>The Program's mandate derives from the <em>Food and Drugs Act</em> (F&amp;DA), the <em>Food and Drug Regulations</em>, the <em>Department of Health Act</em>, the <em>Pest Control Products Act</em>, the <em>Public Health Agency of Canada Act</em>, and the <em>Canadian Food Inspection Agency Act</em>. The Program carries out activities aimed at preserving and promoting the health of Canadians, which include conducting assessments of food industry submissions; developing, updating and disseminating policies, guidelines, regulations, standards, strategies, and consumer information; conducting health risk and benefit assessments to manage food safety incidents and assessing the effectives of CFIA activities related to food safety;<sup><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn1" id="fnb1-ref"><span class="wb-1nv">Footnote </span>1</a></sup> conducting surveillance and monitoring; conducting applied scientific research and method development to support food and nutrition policy decision-making; and, coordinating priorities and risk management approaches within Canada's food safety system.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<h3>CONCLUSIONS - RELEVANCE </h3>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<h4>Continued need</h4>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p><strong>The Program continues to address a demonstrable need.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>Program activities are designed to address known and emerging FSNQ issues. On-going scientific developments, market changes, and evolving consumer preferences, will continue to present challenges, which the Program is in the best position to address. Its legislative framework has been under pressure over the last decade to become a more integrated and flexible tool that can allow the Program to better operate internally and more quickly react to evolving scientific and market needs.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<h4>Alignment with Government Priorities</h4>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p><strong>The Program is aligned with government priorities.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>Speeches from the Throne over the years have recognized the importance of FSNQ and identified federal priorities aimed at strengthening Canada's food safety system and ensuring nutrition quality. The Program seeks to address these federal priorities through an inclusive approach reflected in relevant Program planning documents. Program objectives are aligned with relevant strategic outcomes from Health Canada and the Public Health Agency of Canada.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<h4>Alignment with Federal Roles and Responsibilities</h4>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p><strong>The Program is aligned with federal roles and responsibilities.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>The Program operates within a legislative framework designed to address priorities through policy development and standard setting, health promotion activities, risk and disease prevention, disease investigation, research and monitoring as well as national and international cooperation. Relevant Acts identify roles and responsibilities that enable key Program participants to operate within the established federal parameters. The Program acts as the umbrella under which federal activities related to the FSNQ are managed.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<h3>CONCLUSIONS - PERFORMANCE </h3>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<h4>Achievement of Expected Outcomes (Effectiveness)</h4>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<h5>Immediate Outcomes</h5>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p><strong>While Canadian food safety performance is high, issues of timeliness, in particular with respect to pre-market submission reviews, may be delaying the entry of foods into the market.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>Overall, pre-market submission assessments are not meeting the regulated time standards (61% increase between FY 2007-2008 and 2012-2013) while some volumes (novel food and food additive) declined between FY 2011-2012 and the third quarter of 2012-2013. During this last period, submissions without regulated time standards saw an increase in some volumes (food packaging and food processing aids) and a decrease in others (incidental additive). FD uses a collaborative approach to submission assessment; however, the evaluation identified several issues contributing to the submission review backlog. Among these, outstanding petitioner information as well as timeliness and communications with respect to the submissions review process are of particular concern to industry stakeholders and contribute to delays.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>Trend analysis data points to an increase in CFIA requests for technical advice, which combined with existing FD challenges related to Health Risk Assessment (HRA) preparation may put pressure on future performance.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p><strong>Changes in awareness and understanding were difficult to assess since the Program does not measure uptake of the information it produces. There are areas where further information or education is needed to improve consumer understanding. Some information delivery mechanisms may not be as effective in relaying information to the intended targets/populations.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>The impact of the Program's products and activities on public awareness and understanding cannot be determined since the Program does not measure or track uptake by audience and time period (with the exception of the Listeria social marketing strategy). A key challenge to understanding impact is a lack of alignment between delivery mechanism and target population preferences. This limited “information tailoring” may negatively impact awareness and understanding by reducing communication effectiveness and contributing to uneven public awareness and understanding. Areas requiring further information/education include food safety, nutrition and healthy eating, nutrition labelling, trans fats, and genetically modified foods.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p><strong>The Program actively engages in international standard development. Its scientific and regulatory research has made important contributions to the international community.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>The Program is active in international collaboration. The Program's contributions to the development of international standards are widely recognized. Most international work is conducted through Codex Alimentarius. The Program is also involved in activities with other international organizations (e.g., the World Health Organization) and has played a leading role in the creation of the International Food Chemical Safety and Microbial Food Safety Liaison Groups.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p><strong>There are some examples of knowledge development by the Program such as research for the enhancement of methods of analysis and testing as well as the development of guidelines and standards. The Program uses this improved knowledge to support regulatory and policy development as well as collaborative work.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>Knowledge development by the Program is exemplified through method development and validation. There are guidelines, standards, frameworks and policies in high priority areas that have been impacted or developed due to advancement in scientific and regulatory research. There are concerns related to the need for increased laboratory capacity to satisfy current and emerging demands, to remain abreast of scientific advances, and to increase internal expertise in a number of fields (e.g., biostatistics, epidemiology, electro-microscopy, bioinformatics, etc.). </p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p><strong>The Program coordinates priorities and risk management approaches within Canada's FSNQ system and contributes to improved collaboration with partners and stakeholders. There are some issues to be addressed with respect to communications and procedures related to Food Safety Assessments (FSAs) and HRAs.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>The Program engages in coordination and collaboration through committees and initiatives that include key Program participants, partners and stakeholders. While Health Canada has enhanced the efficiency and reliability of its HRA process to respond to CFIA requests, there are some opportunities to enhance communications and information exchange between Health Canada and CFIA. In the case of FSAs, Health Canada/CFIA collaboration has experienced a number of procedural, planning and operational challenges. A number of events, including the change in the reporting relationship of CFIA to the Minister of Health and the discontinuation of the FSAP Advisory Committee, are also likely to have an impact on the conduct of FSAs</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<h5>Intermediate Outcomes</h5>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p><strong>While it is not known if consumers have made healthier food choices as a result of Program efforts, evidence points to issues of concern related to the dietary intake of the general population and of First Nations and Inuit communities.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>Consumer choices suggest high calorie intake from fat and snacks, vegetable and fruit consumption below the recommended daily minimum, a tendency towards fast food and commercially prepared food consumption, and sodium intakes in excess of the Upper Limit. In the case of First Nations on-reserve and Inuit communities, sodium intakes exceed recommended limits and the consumption of certain food groups is below recommended levels; some food decisions may be affected by food insecurity and its influencing factors, including environmental changes, poverty and high food costs. Data on the success of food labels is inconsistent.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p><strong>The number of cases of reported enteric diseases appears to have declined over the past decade, while compliance rates for chemical residue testing have remained overall high. While the change in exposure to nutritional risks could not be ascertained, some Program initiatives appear to be contributing to risk reduction in certain areas.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>The number of cases of reported enteric diseases appears to have declined over the past decade (by 48% according to C-EnterNet data and by 42% according to Notifiable Diseases Online), while compliance rates for chemical residue testing have remained overall high (at or above 95%). Program initiatives, such as awareness campaigns, efforts on trans fat reduction and food fortification, have, in theory, effected changes in the exposure to certain nutritional benefits.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p><strong>While it was not possible to identify a change in the level of adoption, there is evidence of adherence by Canada to international standards. Other countries' membership in international standard setting organizations denotes an interest in harmonization.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>There is evidence of Canadian adherence to international standards. Some delays in adhering to these standards have been linked to lengthy regulatory approval processes (e.g., approval of asparaginase as a food additive) or to concerns with international approaches that may not reflect the Program's position.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p><strong>The Program seeks a more integrated approach to Federal/Provincial/Territorial (F/P/T) food safety and nutrition priorities and activities by collaborating with F/P/T partners and stakeholders.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>The Program actively collaborates with key Program participants, partners, and stakeholders by exchanging information, fostering dialogue, consulting, and coordinating priorities and risk management approaches. More structured stakeholder communications and improved transparency regarding Program activities are needed (e.g., to clarify roles and responsibilities between the Program and its P/T partners).</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<h5>Long-Term Outcomes</h5>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p><strong>According to available evidence, the nutritional status of Canadians does not appear to have improved over the period of the evaluation.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>Among the general population, there are a number of concerns related to high energy intake, high fat intake, nutrient insufficiency, sodium intakes associated with an increased risk of adverse health effects, and rising Body Mass Index. While information on First Nations on-reserve and Inuit communities has been limited, evidence points to low intake of some important vitamins and minerals, high sodium intakes and obesity prevalence.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p><strong>Food-related illnesses appear to have decreased over the past decade. Nutrition-related illnesses among the general Canadian population appear to have increased during the same period. The rates of diabetes among First Nations on-reserve are higher than those of the overall Canadian population but seem not to have increased for the last several years (high blood pressure rates have also remained relatively stable). Rates of diabetes and high blood pressure among Inuit populations approach those of the overall Canadian population.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>The number of cases of reported enteric diseases appears to have declined over the past decade, while compliance rates for chemical residue testing have remained overall high. The rates of hypertension, diabetes and heart disease among the general population, three chronic conditions related to nutrition, have increased over the last decade. For First Nations on-reserve, the rates of diabetes are high compared to the overall Canadian population, although these do not appear to have increased for the last several years (similar to high blood pressure rates). Rates of diabetes and high blood pressure among Inuit populations approach those of the overall Canadian population.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p><strong>The Program contributes to safer food products in international trade. Adoption of international standards by other countries is expected to contribute to international food safety.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>The Program is engaged with international regulatory partners and participates in international fora as part of efforts to standardize, harmonize and increase food safety. Adoption of international standards by other countries is expected to contribute to maintaining and improving food safety.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p><strong>Through the activities/contribution of the Program, Canada is viewed as a responsible participant and scientific expert in an international context.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>The Program's expertise and contribution to the international community are recognized through its involvement in standard development, as a host of international collaborating centres and laboratories, and as a partner in international capacity development.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p><strong>The Program seeks to maintain an integrated system for FSNQ in Canada through consultation and collaboration with partners and stakeholders. There are challenges to the responsiveness of the regulatory framework, which recent legislative amendments and Program strategic plans are expected to address.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>The Program's approach to consultation and collaboration seeks to engage all partners and stakeholders and is expected to continue to enhance system integration. Government Directives are in place to guarantee a consultative, coordinated and cooperative approach to regulatory development. The level of responsiveness of the regulatory framework, while challenged, may be improved by recent amendments to the F&amp;DA (e.g., Incorporation by Reference).</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<h5>Demonstration of Economy and Efficiency</h5>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p><strong>Program performance and financial information was insufficient to properly demonstrate efficiency and economy.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>Financial data available for the evaluation was insufficient to support an analysis of efficiency and economy. As a result, the evaluation could not assess the extent to which Program resources were used as planned, whether Program outputs were produced efficiently, or whether expected outcomes were produced economically. The collection of performance data does not appear to be consistent or follow a Program approach to its analysis; there are a variety of measures and formats used and efforts tend to focus on tracking mainly Program outputs. There are a number of Program areas where process performance may be affecting efficiency (e.g., the pre-market submission assessment process, the HRA process and its infrastructure, stakeholder communication effectiveness, laboratory research capacity, the FSA process, and regulatory modernization). The Program makes limited use of public-private partnerships and outsourcing while it lacks a cost recovery framework to better manage the costs of its pre-market processes.</p>

<td rowspan="5">The FD conducts mandatory pre-market submission reviews for infant formula, food additives and novel foods, as well as pre-market evaluations for other products (e.g. functional food, processing aids, packaging materials, etc.) as part of its proactive guidance to industry i.e. on a non- mandatory basis.<br/><br/> As part of the effort to reduce the backlog of submissions that were past the performance standard for review, the following actions were taken:
    <ul class="indentNone">
<li>Established targets to reduce the backlog by 75% by September 2014</li>
<li>Clearly and transparently informed industry of a new policy for mandatory pre-market submissions with outstanding deficiencies that have been awaiting response from petitioners for over 6 months to manage the predictability of the pre-market submission process.</li>
<li>Clearly stating criteria for which petitioners could keep their file active as well as criteria by which the FD would close the file. The 30 day Deficiency Response Initiative for Food Additive, Infant Formula and Novel Food Submissions has been implemented.</li>
<li>A real-time workflow monitoring of pre-market reviews would facilitate transparency to petitioners by providing instantaneous information about the status of a review and consequently add predictability to the process, by identifying the time remaining for completing the review within the performance standards. The FD completed a business requirement document for a submission management database proposal and received support through the Department's Investment Plan process (IP 106).It is expected that this system would evolve towards a web enabled database providing petitioners with real time updates on their submission processing.</li>
</ul> HC supported legislative amendments of the Food and Drugs Act and subsequent regulatory amendments to enable a faster process for regulatory approval of <a href="/en/health-canada/services/food-nutrition/food-safety/food-additives/lists-permitted.html">food additives</a> in Canada. This process reduces the timelines of regulatory handling from over 18 months to about 3-4 months.<br/><br/> As part of on-going program improvements, HC will proceed with subsequent updates to Division 16 of the Food and Drugs Act pertaining to food additives, and will issue an updated guidance document for industries on the preparation of food additives under the modernized regime.<br/><br/> The FD will also leverage advice provided by its Food Expert Advisory Committee to engage stakeholders on and launch an 'enhanced transparency framework for food regulatory decisions'. The framework will encompass actions specific to food pre-market activities and will include measures such as the systematic publication and engagement on outcomes of the scientific assessment underpinning HC's food premarket approvals as well as systematic publication of the list of premarket submissions made to HC's Food Directorate upon concurrence of petitioners.</td>

</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">

</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<ul>
<li>FD conducts assessments of food industry submissions; develops, updates and disseminates policies, guidelines, regulations, standards, strategies and consumer information to support Canadians in their decisions about food and diet; performs health risk benefit assessments; conducts surveillance and monitoring; conducts research and method development in support of programs; and, coordinates priorities and risk management approaches within Canada's food safety system. In the case of a foodborne illness outbreak in more than one province, FD supports the Public Health Agency of Canada and CFIA as part of the coordinated federal investigation and response by providing Health Risk Assessments (HRAs) to inform decision-making.</li>
<li>BFSA assessed the effectiveness of CFIA's activities related to food safety. Its objectives were to provide advice and guidance to CFIA on its food safety activities as well as offer feedback to assist Health Canada in carrying out its role of developing food safety and nutrition policies and standards as mandated under Section 11(4) of the CFIA Act.</li>
<li>ONPP is the focal point for public health nutrition within the federal government and drives the agenda to promote healthy eating amongst Canadians. ONPP works closely with FD and other partners, within and external to the Health Portfolio,<sup><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn8" id="fnb8-ref"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>8</a></sup> to provide Canadians with consistent, credible, evidence-based policies, guidelines and resources on healthy eating. To this end, ONPP carries out research and monitoring, policy and promotion activities related to public health nutrition.</li>
<li>VDD conducts pre- and post-market assessments of industry submissions on veterinary drugs, and conducts monitoring and standard setting activities associated with the safety, quality and effectiveness of drugs used in animals. VDD develops standards, polices and regulations concerning the sale of veterinary drugs for use in food-producing animals and the resulting drug residues in foods derived from animals such as meat, milk, eggs and honey. VDD provides assistance to CFIA in managing food safety incidents related to the presence of “violative” [<em>sic</em>] veterinary drug residues.</li>
<li>RAPB is responsible for the regionally based programs and laboratories. Food related laboratories exist in four regions and food policy liaison officers represent the Program in each region through six regional offices.</li>
<li>FNIHB's IAPSD supports the development and delivery of nutrition-related policies, programs and services for First Nations on-reserve and Inuit communities. IAPSD is also responsible for surveillance and risk analysis pertaining to the chemical safety of traditional foods and health promotion activities focussed on the prevention of enteric disease outbreaks in First Nations communities.</li>
<li>PMRA is responsible for pest management regulation through the administration of the PCPA. PMRA's primary objective is to prevent unacceptable risks to Canadians and the environment from the use of pest control products; this includes scientific evaluations of food-use pesticides and setting science based Maximum Residue Limits (MRLs) for each pest-crop combination.</li>
<li>IDPC, within the Public Health Agency of Canada, is responsible for health risk surveillance and assessment activities. The Public Health Agency of Canada maintains surveillance systems that track foodborne illness pathogens in animals (and their products) and in plant products. The Agency also tracks human illnesses and diet-related chronic diseases, and works in the coordinated management of food-borne illness outbreaks. The Public Health Agency of Canada also undertakes Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) surveillance activities through the Canadian Integrated Program for Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance (CIPARS), which supports VDD's pre- and post-market risk assessment of the use of antimicrobials in food animals. The Public Health Agency of Canada also conducts epidemiological and laboratory-based research. In the case of a foodborne illness outbreak in more than one province, the Public Health Agency of Canada is the lead that coordinates F/P/T investigation and response supported by CFIA and FD.</li>
<li>CFIA enforces policies, regulations and standards, set by Health Canada, governing the safety and nutritional quality of all food sold in Canada through activities that include the registration and inspection of abattoirs and food processing plants as well as the testing of products. If a food safety event occurs, CFIA, in partnership with Health Canada, provincial agencies and the food industry, operates an emergency response system. In the case of a foodborne illness outbreak in more than one province, CFIA supports FD and the Public Health Agency of Canada as part of the coordinated F/P/T response by conducting the food safety investigation led by the Public Health Agency of Canada.</li>

<td>The large number of Program partners and stakeholders made it impractical to collect representative information. While valuable, interview data reflected individual opinions/perspectives relevant at the time of the interviews (October to December 2009). Lack of valid contacts, lack of coverage of some groups (i.e., cost-shared managers, health promotion and international stakeholders, in particular the WHO and Codex), and poor response limited the comprehensiveness of the information gathered through this method.</td>
<td>While interview data was mostly used to provide background and context to the findings, in cases when documented evidence was not available the reliance on interview data was higher, thus leading to potential bias.</td>
<td>Evaluators used a stratified purposive sampling<sup><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn16" id="fnb16-ref"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>xvi</a></sup> approach and engaged key Program participants to generate a list of individuals knowledgeable about FSNQP<sup><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn17" id="fnb17-ref"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>xvii</a></sup> across all identified organizations. In this way, although the sample was not representative of the population or produced statistically significant results, the information collected allowed evaluators to delve into areas requiring clarification and to obtain information where documented evidence was insufficient. By triangulating interview information with other sources, the potential for bias was reduced to the extent possible. However, in cases when documented evidence was not available and the analysis relied more heavily on interview information (and, therefore, depended on the high level of knowledge of the individuals interviewed) this fact has been noted in the report.<br/><br/> Although the formal interview process took place in 2009, the evaluators maintained an open communication channel with Program representatives to confirm the validity of the information presented in the report.</td>

<h3 id="a41">4.1 Relevance: Issue # 1 - Continued Need for the Program</h3>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p><strong>Does the Program continue to address a demonstrable need? Is the Program responsive to the needs of Canadians?</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p><strong>The Program continues to address a demonstrable need. Addressing known and emerging issues related to food production, processing and distribution is a key priority of the Program's activities.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>FSNQ plays an important role in Canadians' health status. The Program, in an effort to maintain and improve this health status, is in a continuous state of evolution to address current and emerging issues, partner and stakeholder perceptions/expectations, and legislative requirements. Addressing known and emerging issues related to food production, processing and distribution is a key priority of the Program's activities. These activities include regulatory development and communication, pre- and post-market assessments, scientific research, surveillance and monitoring, risk analysis, health promotion, disease prevention and control, and coordination of FSNQ initiatives. All of these activities, in combination or singularly, are designed to address relevant Program areas. The following areas of on-going concern demonstrate the need for the Program:</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<ul>
<li>Traditional microbial (e.g., bacteria such as Salmonella and Listeria monocytogenes [L. monocytogenes]) and chemical food safety hazards (e.g., food-processing-induced chemicals).<sup title="reference">356,148,110</sup></li>
<li>Emergent and re-emergent pathogens as a result of multiple factors such as food manufacturing processes that may introduce unwanted agents; agricultural processes that may allow for the introduction of food-related pathogens; microbial adaptation/AMR to interventions (e.g., treatment-resistant pathogens, antimicrobial resistant genes); and, globalization of the food supply (e.g., population migration, travel, diverse food safety infrastructure among food producers, etc.).<sup title="reference">356</sup></li>
<li>New technologies, the determination of their acceptable risk (tolerance), and the development of new detection methodologies, for example: pesticides; heavy metals, growth hormones, antibiotics, fertilizers, Genetically Modified (GM) organisms and their derivatives (e.g., GM foods, transgenic animals and cloning), biotechnology, nanotechnology, irradiation, and additives.<sup title="reference">356,337,22,433,174,156,148</sup></li>
<li>New use of food as a health delivery agent, for example functional foods (e.g., nutraceuticals) and non-traditional micronutrients (e.g., lycopenes, beta-carotenes and isoflavones).<sup title="reference">356,359,15,156</sup></li>
<li>By-products from food safety and nutritional quality approaches, their identification and risk assessment, such as: 
  <ul>
<li>Undeclared allergens, natural toxins (e.g., mycotoxins in cereals), trans fats, and endocrine disruptors.<sup title="reference">174,156,148</sup></li>
<li>Obesity, diabetes, and dietary needs of the general Canadian population as well as vulnerable population groups.</li>
</ul> </li>
<li>Unpredictable hazards, e.g., adulterants: melamine, malachite green, Sudan dyes, etc.</li>
<li>Food security issues in First Nations and Inuit communities, including the potential for higher exposure to environmental chemicals through some traditionally harvested foods.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>Other perspectives on Program activities reveal broader areas for continued Program involvement. For example, in the case of the legislative framework, <em>A review of Canadian food safety policy and its effectiveness in addressing health risks for Canadians</em> (2002) found that the legislative framework was non-prescriptive, allowing programs to determine its implementation, thus subject to economic, political and other pressures that may lead to conflicting directives. The same review suggested that food safety regulations were having difficulties keeping pace with many of the new developments.<sup title="reference">356</sup> Also, a 2011 survey on Canadians' awareness, attitudes and behaviours with respect to food safety (n<sub>1</sub>=1,003, n<sub>2</sub>=1,001, n<sub>focus groups </sub>~36) reported that while 89% of Canadians were at a minimum moderately confident in the food system, there were concerns that it was over-burdened and there was some confusion about how the system works.<sup title="reference">343</sup></p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>In the case of surveillance, concerns over the safety of imported products appear to have been increasing in recent years.<sup title="reference">180,181,195,343 </sup> Some key Program participants and partners believed that improvements could be made in the level of safety of the non-registered sector and imported foods.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>With respect to food safety information, testimony provided in the <em>Beyond the Listeriosis Crisis Report</em> (2009) remarked on the weakness of the Canadian food safety system on providing risk communications while suggesting that “the public does not have much knowledge about our food standards and food safety programs and that the government should focus on educating the public.” Further testimony recommended that “communication be harmonized, integrated, and planned between industry and government and urged that on-going investment is required to deliver food safety messaging to consumers” as “campaigns aimed at changing behaviour can take 20 to 30 years to gain significant traction in the marketplace.”<sup title="reference">28 </sup></p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>Finally, with respect to nutrition labelling, a 2007 report by the Advisor on Healthy Children &amp; Youth (henceforth referred to as <em>Reaching for the Top</em>) identified portion size as a significant contribution to the obesity problem. The same report stated that in “the absence of a Canada-wide system, food companies and health organizations have created their own individual labelling systems which are confusing for consumers.”<sup title="reference">344</sup> The Heart Health Strategy and Action Plan Steering Committee report <em>Building a Heart Healthy Canada</em> (2009) remarked that while Canada is an international leader in mandatory food labelling on packaged foods, only 61% of women and 52% of men “always or usually” read the nutrition facts panel on product labels, and those who do often find the information confusing. One of the main weaknesses in Canada's nutrition facts panel is that there is no standard serving size.<sup title="reference">47</sup> The 2010 report delivered by the Sodium WG commissioned by Health Canada under the title <em>Sodium Reduction Strategy for Canada</em> observed that food product labels present challenges to consumers, including interpretation of the % Daily Value (DV) and the specific amount of food presented on labels.<sup title="reference">229</sup></p>

<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p><strong>Federal priorities related to FSNQ include strengthening Canada's food system to address emerging issues and risk factors thus protecting the health of Canadians, which are in line with Program objectives. Departmental and Agency objectives are aligned with strategic outcomes related to the Program area.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>Speeches from the Throne over the years have recognized the importance of FSNQ by identifying federal priorities related to strengthening Canada's food safety system, increasing oversight of food, addressing risk factors (including nutrition), and introducing measures to ensure Canadians' have confidence in the quality and safety of the food on their tables.<sup title="reference">122,123,124,125,126,132,128</sup></p>

<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>The Program seeks to address federal priorities through an inclusive approach, which has as its goal the risk-based identification and prioritization of issues. This approach is reflected in several of the Program's planning and reporting documents such as annual reports, business plans, departmental operational plans, Reports on Plans and Priorities (RPPs), and Regulatory Directives. These documents identify areas for action related to each of the Program's key activities.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>For example, Health Canada documents identify areas for action related to microbial and chemical food safety (e.g., emerging pathogens, extraneous materials in foods, pesticide re-evaluation), nutritional quality (e.g., food fortification and claims), food surveillance and monitoring, consumer information (e.g., providing food safety advice or dietary guidance to First Nations and Inuit communities), research and FSNQP coordination (national and international). In the case of the Public Health Agency of Canada, documents address areas related to the prevention and control of infectious diseases, preparedness to respond to emerging infectious diseases and initiatives related to food safety (including collaboration), among others.<sup title="reference">148,156,174,305,314,338,387,391,388,389,390,392,412,413</sup></p>

<p>The federal government has created an intricate legislative framework to enable the Program to operate. Components of this framework identify a number of priorities related to policy development and standard setting, health promotion activities, risk and disease prevention, disease investigation, research and monitoring as well as national and international cooperation among others. The same components also identify roles and responsibilities that enable key Program participants to operate within the established federal jurisdiction, for example:</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<ul>
<li>The <em>Department of Health Act</em> sets responsibilities for the Minister of Health, including public health promotion, preservation and protection from risks and diseases, investigation and research (including disease monitoring), collection of data, and cooperation with provincial authorities with the goal of coordinating efforts intended to preserve and improve public health.<sup title="reference">79 </sup></li>

<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>Health Canada's pre-market assessments of industry food submissions play a key role in ensuring the availability of safe and nutritious foods in Canada and, as a consequence, have an effect on the increased availability of said foods. An industry submission is a request to Health Canada from an importer or manufacturer (the petitioner) to market a new food product in Canada. FD assesses these submissions according to regulatory requirements to help ensure that the food product is safe (except for health claims for which the department determines whether the claim is truthful and not misleading).<sup title="reference">190</sup></p>

Novel food, infant formula and novel fibre submissions go through pre-market notification, which consists of a safety assessment to demonstrate that the food is safe and nutritious before entry into the market. Food additive, food irradiation and food fortification submissions first go through a safety assessment process after which, if successful, a management committee decides if the submission should proceed through the regulatory phase leading to amendments to the F&amp;DR. Market access to food additives, food irradiation and food fortification is approved after amendments have been published in the Canada Gazette Part II or if an Interim Marketing Authorization<sup><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn19" id="fnb19-ref"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>19</a></sup>,<sup><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn20" id="fnb20-ref"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>20</a></sup> (IMA) is granted.

<p>The tables show an increasing trend in the number of submissions with F&amp;DR timelines awaiting completion at the end of each FY. While the outstanding volumes for novel food and food additive submissions showed marked declines between FY 2011-2012 and the third quarter of FY 2012-2013 (-7% and -20%, respectively), the number of infant formula submissions awaiting completion increased by 15% during the same time period. Similarly, for those submissions without F&amp;DR timelines, the outstanding volume of incidental additive submissions decreased considerably (-88%) due in part to fewer new submissions received during the first three quarters of FY 2012-2013; however, the outstanding volumes for food packaging and processing aid submissions increased considerably (22% and 73%, respectively).</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>In the case of food packaging submissions, the increase reflects growing reliance by the food industry on FD's Letters of No Objection (LONOs). The F&amp;DR do not require mandatory approval of food packaging products<sup><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn36" id="fnb36-ref"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>36</a></sup> and put the onus on the food seller (manufacturer, distributor, etc.) to ensure that packaging materials used in the sale of food products will meet these requirements.<sup title="reference">384 </sup> Packaging materials can be submitted voluntarily by the food seller to FD for a pre-market assessment of their chemical safety; in return, FD may provide a LONO expressing a favourable opinion, which can be used by the food seller to assure its customers that the products have been evaluated by FD and deemed acceptable.<sup title="reference">384</sup> All packaging materials produced in Canada or imported into Canada for use in CFIA federally registered establishments<sup><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn37" id="fnb37-ref"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>37</a></sup> must go through the same CFIA approval process as long as they are covered by CFIA administered Acts.<sup><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn38" id="fnb38-ref"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>38</a></sup>,<sup><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn39" id="fnb39-ref"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>39</a></sup> In the case of imports, depending on the country of origin, there may be similar regulated or standard requirements and Canada may perform some audits when controls may be significantly lower in other countries.

</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>While FD uses a collaborative approach to submission assessment (as evidenced by the involvement of multiple Bureaux with most submissions) to address the complexity and cross-cutting nature of many submissions as well as to increase overall efficiency and timeliness, the evaluation identified several issues contributing to the submission review backlog:</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<ul>
<li>Insufficient coordination between bureaux and divisions as recently as 2009, which has led to process inconsistencies and the lack of a coordinated mechanism to screen and prioritize submissions. The pre-market submission assessment process operated on a first-in/first-out basis with no formal, risk-based priority process or triage, although exceptions did occur (e.g., asparaginase).</li>
<li>Until recently, FD had no performance standard for completing submissions dealing with categories of food products not covered by the F&amp;DR (e.g., processing aid, health claims) and had not required petitioners to respond to requests for additional information within a set time.<sup title="reference">315,151,190 </sup></li>
<li>The F&amp;DR do not make reference to any penalties in the case that Health Canada does not meet its performance standards (i.e., any sanctions to provide incentives to comply with performance standards).<sup title="reference">102 </sup></li>
<li>Health Canada does not accept novel food and food additive pre-market submission assessments performed and approved in other jurisdictions (although these are considered by FD's Food Rulings Committee)<sup><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn41" id="fnb41-ref"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>41</a></sup> while this is done by some international counterparts.<sup><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn42" id="fnb42-ref"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>42</a></sup> Health Canada has encouraged industry to make joint submissions to speed the process.<sup title="reference">223,293</sup> Recognizing food additive and health claim submissions made in other jurisdictions has been an issue raised at the Food Supply Chain Stakeholders meetings,<sup><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn43" id="fnb43-ref"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>43</a></sup> while accepting credible scientific reviews from other jurisdictions has been identified as an outstanding issue by other sources.<sup title="reference">100,484,28,223,293</sup></li>
<li>The timelines specified in the F&amp;DR do not appear to align with the level of effort related to some submission types (e.g., 45 days and 90 days for novel food and food additive submissions, respectively, are considered insufficient due to the inherent complexity of said submissions). These timelines have not been benchmarked against those adopted by other international food regulatory agencies.</li>
<li>The regulatory approval/amendment process is lengthy and lacks the legal human resources (e.g., lawyers, legal aids) necessary to address regulatory challenges or changes (in 2010, there were over 90 regulatory amendments outstanding, which FD has bundled into alike packages with the expectation of expediting them<sup title="reference">223</sup>). <sup title="reference">87,99,98,190,227,269</sup></li>
<li>A lack of human resources (i.e., assessors).</li>
<li>Outstanding petitioner information.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>The issues of outstanding petitioner information as well as timeliness and communications with respect to the submissions review process are of particular concern to industry stakeholders and contribute to delays.<sup title="reference">293,223,294</sup> While FD makes use of engagement activities (e.g., meetings, workshops) to communicate with stakeholders and has been improving its efforts to make processes clearer (e.g., by posting policies, guidance and check lists on Health Canada's Web site), the effectiveness of these efforts remains unclear. According to interviews, some industry respondents believed that scientific requirements for submissions (data requirements) were unclear, thus leading to the re-submission of information or the need for additional research (specific problems have been encountered with health claims and novel foods); at the same time, some FD representatives believed that rejections of submissions were due to insufficient scientific data (e.g., in the case of additives) provided by petitioners. Other issues related to clarity, such as the difference between food additive and processing aid as well as the lack of a definition for adulteration, may also contribute to experienced delays, for example:<sup title="reference">223,294 </sup></p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<ul>
<li>Like all substances used with food, the use of a processing aid<sup><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn44" id="fnb44-ref"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>44</a></sup> is ultimately controlled by section 4, part I of the F&amp;DA.<sup title="reference">194 </sup> However, “there is no regulatory definition of food processing aid in Canada” and “most processing aids are not mentioned in the regulations.”<sup title="reference">194 </sup> Although FD has developed a decision tree to identify food additives and processing aids,<sup title="reference">194 </sup> “the regulatory definition of 'food additive' is the primary basis for differentiating food additives and processing aids: a substance is a food additive if it is used in a manner that would cause it to meet this definition” (i.e., “a substance in and of itself is not necessarily a food additive or a processing aid” but “the conditions surrounding its use may cause it to be one or the other”).<sup title="reference">194 </sup> Although the definition of food additive is encompassing of processing aid applications, it has been the practice of Health Canada to not subject the latter to mandatory pre-clearance.<sup title="reference">194 </sup></li>
<li>Although the F&amp;DA does not offer a definition of the term “adulterated,” it indicates in clause 30(1)(a) that the Governor in Council may make regulations “declaring that any food or drug or class of food or drugs is adulterated if any prescribed substance or class of substances is present therein or has been added thereto or extracted or omitted therefrom.”<sup title="reference">103 </sup> According to Bill C-28, which was introduced in the House of Commons by the Minister of Health in November 2004 and approved in October 2005, “a food may be considered as adulterated only if it contains a substance prescribed in the regulations and is present in amounts other than the specified levels.”<sup title="reference">30 </sup> The same Bill permits foods with higher than allowable limits of agricultural chemicals, veterinary drugs or pesticides to be sold if they have been issued an IMA by the Minister of Health “if he or she determines that the food would not be harmful to the health of the purchaser or consumer.”<sup title="reference">30 </sup></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>As part of efforts to address these challenges, in 2007 FD began a process to integrate and standardize the pre-market submission assessment process for infant formula, novel foods and food additives.<sup title="reference">207</sup> This process would then be used for other submissions as improvements became evident. A consultation process was held and industry comments invited on a <em>Draft Guidance Document - Management of Pre-Market Submissions</em> (2007).<sup title="reference">169</sup> Although the document did not address submission prioritization, the evaluation found that the coordination process was being improved through the engagement of what was then the Bureau of Food Policy Integration (BFPI) as the lead in communicating new submissions to all relevant bureaux and by holding assessor meetings.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>In 2010, FD established a Submission Management and Information Unit for novel foods, infant formula and food additives followed by the implementation of a new process for monitoring older submissions.<sup title="reference">227,225,226,228 </sup> Health Canada also devoted efforts to reduce the regulatory backlog for submissions where scientific assessments had been completed, thus moving forward the authorization of food applications (substances/uses) where regulatory amendments were pending, and delaying entry into the Canadian market (between January 1, 2009 and March 31, 2012, 23 food additive regulatory amendments were published in Canada Gazette Part II and 34 food additive IMAs were published in the Canada Gazette Part I<sup><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn45" id="fnb45-ref"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>45</a></sup>).</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>In 2011, FD established an Internal Committee on Submission Governance to develop backlog reduction strategies. By the end of 2011, FD expected to finalize a guidance document on the pre-market submission management process and to establish realistic service standards for food additives, novel foods and infant formulas.<sup title="reference">285 </sup> The same year, FD began the Food Business Systems Modernization (FBSM) project with the goal of “improving the Directorate's core Information Management (IM) functions, capabilities, and processes.” Part of the project aims to modernize “the processes and tools used for the management of pre-market submissions for food additive, infant formula and novel food submissions.” As part of the work, FD began the development of an “up-to-date submission management tracking system” to improve “the timeliness, predictability, transparency, and responsiveness to stakeholders for the pre-market review of food submissions.”<sup title="reference">275 </sup> FD committed to reduce the backlog by 25% in 2012;<sup title="reference">293 </sup> however, according to the data presented in <strong>Table 5 </strong>and<strong> Table 6</strong>, FD may have been unable to attain this target.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>FD has also begun implementing an administrative system for priority scheduling and expedited handling of certain submissions. This system is aimed at moving eligible food additive, food irradiation, novel food and food processing aid submissions through the pre-market safety evaluation phase and, where possible, the authorization phase, more quickly. In order to be considered, submissions must demonstrate a capacity to enhance the microbiological safety of foods as stated in the 2011 policy on <em>Priority scheduling and expedited handling of submissions that have the capacity to enhance food safety</em>.<sup title="reference">277,266,269</sup> As a result of this new policy, Health Canada has begun to receive submissions requesting priority scheduling and expedited handling.<sup title="reference">133 </sup> In 2011, FD also finalized a guidance document on preparing submissions for health claims using existing systematic reviews prepared by regulatory or scientific organizations with standards of evidence similar to those of Health Canada.<sup title="reference">269,285,286 </sup></p>

<h5>Health Risk Assessments</h5>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>FD conducts HRAs as a result of in-house surveys or other available data sources on microbial pathogens and contaminants in foods. FD also conducts HRAs at the request of other groups within Health Canada as well as other government departments and agencies such as CFIA.<sup title="reference">111 </sup> CFIA uses these HRAs to make decisions on food recalls as part of its responsibility for enforcing food-related standards.<sup title="reference">133 </sup></p>

<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>HRAs involve determining if the presence of a certain substance or micro-organism in food (e.g. chemical contaminant, natural toxin, allergen, unapproved food additive, bacteria, virus or parasite) poses a health risk to consumers. Several internal documents as well as the <em>Compendium of Microbiological Safety and General Cleanliness of Foods</em> (or <em>Compendium of Analytical Methods</em>)identify the components of a risk assessment process (i.e., hazard identification, exposure assessment, hazard characterization and risk characterization) and provide definitions for each component.<sup title="reference">201 </sup> The development of this and other compendia (e.g., the <em>Compendium of Food Allergen Methodologies</em> and the <em>Compendium of Methods for Chemical Analysis of Foods</em>) reflects the integration of sound science in the risk assessment process and provides ready reference for industry on HPFB's methodologies.</p>

According to research, the limited popularity of online food safety information sources may be related to stakeholder preferences, for example: </p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<ul>
<li>Studies commissioned by Agriculture and Agri-food Canada (AAFC) in 2004 and 2006 (n=1600) found the following:<sup title="reference">331,332 </sup>
<ul>

</ul> </li>
<li>According to a 2010 survey (n=1,536<sup><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn66" id="fnb66-ref"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>66</a></sup>):<sup title="reference">90</sup>
<ul>
<li>42% of Canadians use traditional media (e.g., newspapers, radio, TV or other media) as their primary source of information for food issues. 
    <ul>
<li>57% of seniors and 32% of parents receive information on food issues through traditional media.</li>
</ul> </li>
<li>24% of Canadians use Web sites as their primary source of food information. 
    <ul>
<li>40% of pregnant women and 31% of parents obtain information on food issues through Web sites (40%).</li>

<ul>
<li>television is the primary source for information on recalls (40%), followed by news (16%), radio (12%) and newspapers (11%); and,</li>
<li>9% of Canadians use the Internet as a source of food safety information.</li>
</ul> </li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>Other factors limiting the effectiveness of FSNQP communications may be linked to the delivery format, for example:</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<ul>
<li>Fragmented information spread across multiple sites that have an inconsistent “feel” and post information with varying degrees of currency leading to consumer difficulty in finding relevant information. The creation of new information portals (e.g., Healthy Canadians, Food Safety) may help to centralize and standardize online information sources.</li>
<li>According to evaluation interviewees, average consumer and some sub-populations (e.g., elderly, First Nations and Inuit, etc.) may find the information to be too technical.</li>
<li>According to evaluation interviews, many First Nations and Inuit communities may have limited online access or limited access to the required peripherals that are available to the general population.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>In the case of engagement activities, the evaluation could not obtain an accurate number of the activities conducted over the evaluation period or determine the success of said activities (e.g., the level of consumer participation); however, some evaluation interviewees (including key Program participants, partners and stakeholders) believed that there had been an increase in consumer participation. Evaluation respondents (key Program participants and stakeholders) engaged with First Nations and Inuit believed that consumer participation had increased as a result of relationship building with national organizations and community representatives as well as initiatives such as the Northern Contaminants Program (NCP); some also believed that there had been a change as a result of federal government organizations acting as the enabler and channel for communications between interested groups (e.g., researchers, community, etc.).</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<h5>Level of Awareness and Understanding</h5>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>According to 2011 data, a large proportion of Canadians (64%) believe that the federal government “has done a good job of keeping Canadians informed of all relevant food safety issues” but 63% “still wish they had more information about food safety and how to protect themselves from foods that pose a health risk.”<sup title="reference">343 </sup> In particular, there are a number of topics requiring more information or education, namely:</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<ul>
<li>Food safety - while 94% of Canadians appeared to be familiar with food safety guidelines,<sup title="reference">331,332 </sup> and in 2011 76% believed they had sufficient information on food safety (84% in the case of pregnant women),<sup title="reference">90 </sup> this awareness may not be translated into understanding. According to a 2011 survey (n<sub>1</sub>=1003, n<sub>2</sub>=1001, n<sub>focus groups</sub>~36), “there is a general misconception among Canadians that most preventable contamination occurs outside of the kitchen;” when asked about food contamination, 52% of Canadians “still believe that contamination occurs before food reaches their kitchens.”<sup title="reference">343 </sup> The same survey notes that some misconceptions regarding food handling are more prevalent among at-risk groups (i.e., pregnant women, people with compromised immune systems, and seniors). According to a 2010 survey (n=1,536), only 60% of Canadians are aware of foodborne illnesses, awareness being higher among people with weakened immune systems and lower among parents with children under six years of age.<sup title="reference">90 </sup></li>
<li>Nutrition and healthy eating - the number of Canadians confident in their nutrition knowledge decreased between 2006 and 2008 (87%<sup title="reference">34 </sup> to 80%<sup title="reference">33 </sup>) and, according to the <em>Sodium Reduction Strategy for Canada </em>(2010), “Canadians lack knowledge about calories and nutrients, which compromises their ability to select nutritious foods” (e.g., little understanding of the % DV and what would be considered “high” or “low” content of a nutrient).<sup title="reference">229 </sup></li>
<li>Nutrition labelling - in a 2005 survey (n=1000), 40% of Canadians had difficulty reading nutrition labels on food packages;<sup title="reference">158 </sup> similarly, a 2007 qualitative study found that nutrition labels are noticed but not always trusted or understood.<sup title="reference">180 </sup> The report <em>Building a Heart Healthy Canada</em> (2009) stated that “although Canada is an international leader in mandatory food labelling on packaged foods, only 61% of women and 52% of men 'always or usually' read the nutrition facts panel on product labels, and those who do often find the information confusing.”<sup title="reference">47 </sup> According to the report <em>Reaching for the Top</em> (2007), “in the absence of a Canada-wide system, food companies and health organizations have created their own individual labelling systems, which are confusing for consumers.”<sup title="reference">344 </sup> The report <em>Building a Heart Healthy Canada</em> (2009) identified the lack of a standard serving size as one of the main weaknesses in Canada's nutrition facts panel, which makes it difficult for consumers to compare the nutritional quality of similar food products.<sup title="reference">47</sup></li>
<li>Trans fats - according to a 2004 survey (n=1423), 36% of Canadians reported that they did not know what the term “trans-fats” signified;<sup title="reference">153</sup> according to the Canadian Council on Food and Nutrition's <em>Tracking Nutrition Trends VII (2008)</em>, “32% of Canadians know that trans fatty acids have the same effect as saturated fats, 24% of Canadians believe that trans fats do not have the same effect as saturated fat, and 27% of Canadians simply do not know.”<sup title="reference">34 </sup></li>
<li>GM foods - according to a 2004 survey (n<sub>8 </sub>=1008 and n<sub>11 </sub>=1003), 17% of Canadians had a poor understanding of GM foods, while 41% believed their understanding to be fair; an equal sized cohort said they had a good (29%) to very good (12%) understanding of these foods.<sup title="reference">160 </sup></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>In the specific case of First Nations, a survey conducted in 2007-2008 (n<sub>I </sub>=1502 and n<sub>II </sub>=1500 First Nations residents living on-reserve) found that 46% of First Nations people living on-reserve knew something about <em>Eating Well with</em> <em>Canada's Food Guide - First Nations, Inuit and Métis</em>, which was launched in 2007.<sup title="reference">196</sup></p>

<h5>Best Practice</h5>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>Funding received through the Food and Consumer Safety Action Plan (FCSAP) and a dedicated funding request to address recommendations<sup title="reference">206,28,484 </sup> stemming from the 2008 Listeriosis outbreak led the Program to develop a strategic and coordinated approach that sought to address several prevalent communication and information dissemination weaknesses. The Listeria social marketing strategy aimed to increase awareness and knowledge of the health risks associated with unsafe food handling practices and foodborne illnesses by influencing the knowledge, attitudes and behaviours of the general public and at-risk groups. Its immediate goal was to increase the use of safe food handling practices with the long term goal of decreasing the incidence of foodborne illness in Canada. To achieve its intended goals, the strategy employed a targeted and multi-pronged approach to information dissemination that went beyond a Web-only push: it included information in annual publications, mail inserts, print media, a radio campaign, and a strategic alliance (see <strong>Appendix 3</strong> for further details). <sup title="reference">49,263,403,74,72,73,237,238,239 </sup></p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>Key Program partners (i.e., Health Canada, the Public Health Agency of Canada and CFIA) worked together in an effort to harmonize and integrate information to make it more accessible to stakeholders. As a result, in 2010 the federal government launched several online Web portals identified in <strong>Appendix 3</strong>. The same organizations also collaborated with P/T governments through the Council of Chief Medical Officers of Health to develop the document <em>Prevention of Listeriosis: Considerations for Development of Public Health Messages</em>, a document that “offers basic information on Listeriosis, and provides prevention advice for the general public, for vulnerable populations and for food service providers serving food to these populations.”<sup title="reference">133 </sup>  The document was made available to P/T governments in 2010 to use as guidance in creating communication messages within each jurisdiction.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>The strategy also included a <em>Survey of Canadians' Knowledge and Behaviour Related to Food Safety</em> (2010) (n=1,536) “designed to establish benchmarks to track the effects of the campaign and provide research intelligence” to “assist [Health Canada and the Public Health Agency of Canada] in the development of evidence-based communications strategies and tactics for use during an outbreak of a foodborne illness”.<sup title="reference">90,418 </sup></p>

<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p><strong>To what extent has the Program influenced international standards?</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p><strong>The Program actively engages in international standard development through a large number of agreements, fora and initiatives. The Program's scientific and regulatory research has made important contributions to the international community. There are a number of initiatives in which the Program has played a role as a lead or contributor. </strong></p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<h5>International Agreements</h5>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>The evaluation identified 22 international Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs), agreements and commitments signed by key Program participants during the period of the evaluation. The purpose of these international agreements is to enhance collaboration and information exchange in order to increase organizational knowledge and enable proper response mechanisms to current and emerging issues. The inherent level of collaboration with each of the organizations identified in the documents (e.g., the US Food and Drug Administration [USFDA], FSANZ, the UK Food Standards Agency [UKFSA], and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control [ECDC]) also allows greater harmonization of approaches and standards.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<h5>International Fora</h5>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>The evaluation identified numerous international fora in which the Program participates to exchange knowledge, achieve consensus and develop standards supported by scientific evidence with the goal of harmonization. Some of these fora are discussed below.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<h6>Codex Alimentarius</h6>

<p>The greater overall activity in microbiological methods may be a reflection of a larger number of events in this area (e.g., outbreaks, emerging threats, etc.); for example, BMH has been actively working on Listeria (spp. and monocytogenes) methods since 1996.<sup title="reference">459</sup> The increase in recent activity (2009-2012) has also been the result of efforts to address recommendations stemming from reports related to the 2008 Listeriosis outbreak and additional funding received by the Program in this area. During this time, FD has validated and maintained 17 methods and laboratory procedures for the isolation and identification, enumeration and genequence of Listeria while at the same time developed guidelines and standards related to food microbiological methods to improve the method review process, for example:</p>

<p>While knowledge improvement and its use are evident from the above examples, interviewees during the evaluation expressed concerns related to the need for increased laboratory capacity to satisfy current and emerging demands, to remain abreast of scientific advances, and to increase internal expertise in a number of fields (e.g., biostatistics, epidemiology, electro-microscopy, bioinformatics, etc.). Some of these concerns are being addressed by the Program as part of broader efforts following the 2008 Listeriosis outbreak, for example:</p>

<p>In 2009, FD created its Food Policy and Science Integration Committee as “the principal intra-Directorate advisory body to discuss and recommend options to address key food safety and nutrition issues.”<sup title="reference">217</sup> Regular members include FD and PPIAD within HPFB, while additional participants can be informed of “agenda items that may be of interest to them, and [would be welcomed]… to attend and participate in discussions on those agenda items should they choose to do so.” Additional participants include VDD, ONPP, the Public Health Agency of Canada and CFIA.<sup title="reference">217</sup> The purpose of the committee is to serve as a forum for discussion and advice on risk management and emerging risks, regulatory decision-making, horizontal science and policy files, and international and interagency international meeting issues; oversee a coordinated response to food risk issues and ensure that food policies are based on science; determine FD's recommended options for action; identify issues for decision-making at HPFB, senior departmental management and/or ministerial level; provide updates to senior management on major science and surveillance projects and review the alignment of laboratory-based work to support food policy development and standard-setting; ensure transparency of process and decision-making through on-going documentation, status reports and follow-up of risk management issues and initiatives.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>In 2009, FD also embarked on the creation of a Food Regulatory Advisory Committee aimed at gathering members with expertise in scientific fields relevant to the mandate of the Directorate from research/academia, health professional/regulatory, industry, and patient and consumer groups. The Committee held its inaugural meeting in September 2010. Later in 2011, the Food Regulatory Advisory Committee was renamed as the Food Expert Advisory Committee (FEAC) to capture areas of its mandate that went beyond food regulatory questions.</p>

<p>As part of the government response to the 2008 Listeriosis outbreak, the Special Committee of Deputy Heads (SCDH) was formed to improve coordination and collaboration among federal departments and agencies that have responsibilities in Canada's food safety system to better position partners to share information and collaborate in response to potential foodborne illness outbreaks. The Committee includes representation from AAFC, Health Canada, the Public Health Agency of Canada and CFIA and Agri-Subcommittee on Food Safety as needed.</p>

<h5>Satisfaction with Collaboration</h5>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>Evaluation interviewees expressed some satisfaction with Program efforts on collaboration and consultation, in particular with P/T governments and regional offices (e.g., through FPTGN, TFTF and FPTFSC), with industry and consumer associations (e.g., through FPTGN and TFTF), with other federal partners (e.g., through FPTGN, TFTF, FPTFSC and federal Food Safety Senior Management meetings involving Health Canada, the Public Health Agency of Canada and CFIA), and with First Nations and Inuit (e.g., through FPTGN, the National Nutrition Advisory, and the Food Security Reference Group).</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>While some interviewees mentioned that there was a lack of integrated strategic planning and engagement with AAFC, recent efforts to increase collaboration between food safety partners (e.g., through SCDH and CFS, the Food Safety Health Risk Assessment Consortium, and the recent integration of CFIA into the Health Portfolio) may already be addressing this concern.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>The evaluation also examined the interaction between Health Canada and CFIA in the case of FSAs and HRAs as presented in the following sub-sections.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<h6>Food Safety Assessments</h6>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>Subsection 11(4) of the CFIA Act states that the “… Minister of Health is responsible for establishing policies and standards relating to the safety and nutritional quality of food sold in Canada and assessing the effectiveness of the Agency's activities related to food safety.”<sup title="reference">35 </sup> An <em>Appendix to Memorandum of Understanding between Health Canada and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency on the Food Safety Assessment Provision contained in Subsection 11(4) of the CFIA Act</em> outlines the general principles and operating procedures to carry out FSAs.<sup title="reference">13 </sup> The <em>Assessment Policy - Food Safety Assessment Program</em> (FSAP) identifies its coverage as assessing “the rationale and design of CFIA's activities; their implementation; and their success in meeting objectives and achieving results including compliance with health and safety standards.”<sup title="reference">154 </sup> To facilitate interaction between Health Canada and CFIA, a FSA Advisory Committee was created to provide corporate guidance for the FSAs of CFIA activities, including overseeing the FSAP planning process, providing advice as needed throughout the conduct of individual FSAs, and reviewing the final assessment reports.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>The evaluation identified a number of issues affecting collaboration and level of satisfaction with this activity:</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<ul>
<li>Poor FSA timeliness due to a number of factors, including conflicting operational demands within CFIA, a long multi-stakeholder review and acceptance process, and CFIA's perceived burden of being audited or evaluated by multiple organizations.<sup><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn83" id="fnb83-ref"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>83</a></sup> BFSA had completed seven FSAs, two assessment frameworks and one paper (partial assessment) in a 10-year period<sup><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn84" id="fnb84-ref"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>84</a></sup> and estimated its coverage of CFIA's inspection programs at 57% over this same period.<sup title="reference">372</sup></li>
<li>Difficulty in planning and priority setting due to a lack of agreement on a risk-based approach to assessment selection and a lack of engagement through the FSA Advisory Committee. While a food safety risk ranking was carried out by the joint Health Canada-CFIA Food Safety Science Committee in 2008 and a list of proposed assessments for the period 2010 to 2015 was identified,<sup title="reference">184,187,167,177,178,183,208,37,219,233</sup> only six meetings of the FSA Advisory Committee took place during the period 2001 to 2007 with no other formal meetings held since the end of 2007.<sup title="reference">261,247,372</sup></li>
<li>Challenges to the approach and methodology used for FSAs due to lack of clarity regarding alignment with evaluation or audit practices. According to the Assessment Policy and the MoU between BFSA and CFIA “the words 'assessing the effectiveness' in the CFIA Act were deliberately chosen to reflect an evaluation approach as described in the Treasury Board Evaluation Policy.”<sup title="reference">154,13</sup></li>
<li>Inconsistent implementation of recommendations due to insufficient monitoring of Management Response and Action Plans before 2007.<sup><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn85" id="fnb85-ref"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>85</a></sup>,<sup title="reference">187</sup> CFIA increased its follow up efforts after this time and all recommendations have been addressed for the assessments completed.<sup><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn86" id="fnb86-ref"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>86</a></sup></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>In order to address these issues, the FSAP began a review in 2010 to assess its relevance, governance, processes, and performance based on an examination by Health Canada of the FSA experience (1999 to 2009) and a consideration of FSAP's future strategic direction in the broader context of food policy development and implementation.<sup title="reference">226,266</sup> As a result, the launch of the next cycle of assessments as well as finalization of a draft multi-year risk-based assessment plan were put on hold pending the external review outcome.<sup title="reference">226,266,285</sup> Health Canada also began a Food Safety Meta-Review project with the objective of identifying broad themes for food safety improvement, best practices and/or lessons learned. The project was based on a document review that included BFSA's FSA reports, CFIA evaluation reports as well as relevant domestic (e.g., Office of the Auditor General of Canada) and international (e.g., Australia, the EU, New Zealand, the UK and the US) food safety reports published between 1999 and 2010.<sup title="reference">226,266,285</sup></p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>A number of events, including the change in the reporting relationship of CFIA to the Minister of Health<sup title="reference">381 </sup> and the discontinuation of the FSAP Advisory Committee, are also likely to affect the conduct of FSAs.</p>

<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<h6>Health Risk Assessments</h6>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>Following the 2008 Listeriosis outbreak, FD committed to make improvements to enhance the efficiency and reliability of CFIA investigations and associated decision-making. The updated SOP <em>Food Directorate Standard Operating Procedures for Providing Health Risk Assessments to the CFIA in the Context of Food Safety Investigations</em> (2011) included confirmed service standard times, procedures for raising awareness of HRA decisions within the ADM Office at HPFB, HRA templates specific to BCS, BMH and BNS, and 24/7 emergency contact numbers to respond to after-hours CFIA requests. Although CFIA-specific, these SOPs are also intended as a guide for responding to HRA requests from other governmental organizations (e.g., P/Ts).<sup title="reference">273,133,255</sup> The same year, Health Canada, the Public Health Agency of Canada and CFIA created a national Food Safety Health Risk Assessment Consortium to perform collaborative risk assessments. The goal of this Consortium is to change the relatively independent approach to risk assessment, which has led to the creation of data gaps and effort duplication, by bringing together F/P/T, academia and industry expertise. This is expected to allow the development of an operational platform through which priority issues can be selected for collaborative studies, including joint Health Canada-Public Health Agency of Canada work.<sup title="reference">279,249,260</sup></p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>While interviewees viewed the working relationship between CFIA and FD as well as the timeliness of responses to enquiries from CFIA as satisfactory, a HRA analysis performed by FD in 2011 identified three areas where communications and procedures specific to CFIA requests could be improved, namely:<sup title="reference">267</sup></p>

<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p><strong>To what extent have consumers made healthier food choices based on Program activities?</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p><strong>It is not known if consumers have made healthier food choices as a result of Program efforts. Available information points to issues of concern related to the dietary intake of the general population (e.g., high calories from fat, sodium intakes exceeding recommended limits) and First Nations and Inuit communities (e.g., consumption of certain food groups below recommended levels). While food labels are viewed as an important tool in helping consumers make informed food choices, the success of this tool is unclear.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>The evaluation was unable to identify conclusive evidence linking changes in consumer food choices to Program contributions (e.g., information products). While increased awareness and understanding of food safety and nutrition related risks and health benefits are expected to contribute to the achievement of this outcome, the Program has not assessed its contributions to this outcome. The evaluation has identified, however, areas where consumers lack awareness or understanding (e.g., nutrition and healthy eating, nutrition labelling, trans fats and GM foods; see immediate outcome # 2).</p>

<p>One of the ways in which the Program can aid the consumer in making healthier food choices is through food labels; however, data on the success of this tool is inconsistent. According to <em>Tracking Nutrition Trends VII</em> (2008), 95% of Canadians who use food labels are able to find the information they need and use it to determine the nutrient and calorie contents of foods, to make comparisons among foods and to determine if the food contains a specific ingredient. The report also states that 68% of Canadians get nutrition information from product labels and identifies the most influential drivers of food choice as low trans fat content (80%), made with whole grains (78%), low in sugar content (72%) and low in salt or sodium content (71%).<sup title="reference">34</sup> Other sources provide different information:</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<ul>
<li>The nutrition facts panel on product labels is “always or usually” read by only 61% of women and 52% of men. One of the main weaknesses in Canada's nutrition facts panel is that there is no standard serving size, which makes it difficult for consumers to compare the nutritional quality of similar food products.<sup title="reference">47 </sup></li>
<li>“Canadians lack knowledge about calories and nutrients, which compromises their ability to select nutritious foods” (e.g., little understanding of the % DV and what would be considered “high” or “low” content of a nutrient).<sup title="reference">229 </sup></li>
<li>Food product labels present challenges to consumers, including interpretation of the % DV and the specific amount of food presented on labels.<sup title="reference">229</sup> Portion size is a significant contributor to the obesity problem.<sup title="reference">344</sup> </li>
<li>Understanding of trans fats changes according to the cohort being interviewed, e.g., a survey conducted in 2004 (n=1,423) reported that 36% of Canadians did not know what “trans fats” signified and that only 46% had high awareness of trans fatty acids;<sup title="reference">153 </sup> another survey (n=over 12,000 Canadian households) that same year reported that 79% of Canadian households were aware of health risks associated with trans fatty acids. <sup title="reference">159</sup></li>

<p>A lack of continuous information has presented challenges. According to the 2005 <em>Food and Nutrition Surveillance System Business Case</em>, no national population-based data on food consumption, and related physical and biological measures, had been collected in the previous three decades. It also identified the lack of a viable, effective, comprehensive national food and nutrition surveillance system in Canada as well as the lack of Health Canada infrastructure to support it. This gap includes the ability to manage data coming from the investment in the <em>Canadian Community Health Survey</em> (CCHS) 2.2,<sup><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn93" id="fnb93-ref"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>93</a></sup> while such systems are widely in place internationally.<sup title="reference">155 </sup> Similarly, data collection on Canadians' dietary intakes has been uneven (prior to 2004, comprehensive food consumption data was collected in 1970-1972) and while the CNF contains valuable information, its food classification system does not align with <em>Canada's Food Guide</em> (which has impeded the analysis of CCHS 2.2 data in relation to the 2007 <em>Canada's Food Guide</em>).<sup><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn94" id="fnb94-ref"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>94</a></sup>,<sup><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn95" id="fnb95-ref"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>95</a></sup> While recent efforts by Statistics Canada (StatCan) and Health Canada may be addressing some data collection issues by repeating CCHS on a continuous basis, the next national nutrition survey is planned to take place in 2015 and the ability to manipulate CCHS data by interested parties (e.g., F/P/T governments, health groups, research institutions and industry) appears restricted due to confidentiality issues.

Program efforts to address emerging issues (e.g., Listeriosis, acrylamide) as well as initiatives to re-assess products already on the market (e.g., pesticide re-evaluation) may be playing a role in reducing exposure to microbial and chemical hazards.

<p>These trends provide an overall positive picture regarding microbial hazards, while some issues of concern remain with specific products. For example, the risks related to the consumption of cheese made from raw or unpasteurized milk (also known as “raw milk cheese”) have been investigated by the Program for over a decade.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>In 2001, after a review by Health Canada and CFIA determined that the application of the outcomes-based EU Directives on raw milk cheese by the French industry included requirements considered to be equivalent or more stringent to those found in Canada, certain French manufacturers were provided with a “special dispensation” permitting them to import and sell their soft raw milk cheeses in Canada in contravention with the F&amp;DR. Later in 2008, after a review by Health Canada, Québec amended its regulations to permit the sale and production of soft and semi-soft raw cheeses that do not comply with the storage requirements of the F&amp;DR,<sup><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn98" id="fnb98-ref"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>98</a></sup> provided the cheese is produced in compliance with specified standards.<sup><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn99" id="fnb99-ref"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>99</a></sup>,<sup title="reference">250,317,321,318,324,325,326,440,441,312,236,353,354</sup></p>

<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>During this time, Health Canada has conducted a number of HRAs, including a <em>Joint FDA/Health Canada quantitative assessment of the risk of Listeriosis from soft-ripened cheese consumption in the United States and Canada</em>,<sup><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn477"><span class="wb-invisible">Footnote </span>477</a></sup> and considered a number of strategies to improve the safety of raw milk cheese (see<strong> Table 13</strong>) due to concerns regarding the efficacy of F&amp;DR requirements. While recent advances in food safety and Good Manufacturing Practices can help to minimize the risks associated with soft and semi-soft raw milk cheese if undertaken by manufacturers of these cheeses, recent research indicates that pathogenic bacteria such as L. monocytogenes, E. coli O157:H7 and Salmonella can survive the production conditions used to make these cheeses and, for some cheese types, the levels of some pathogens such as L. monocytogenes may actually increase during the storage requirement specified in the F&amp;DR.  Consequently, Health Canada determined that the F&amp;DR's current microbiological criteria for soft and semi-soft cheese made from unpasteurized milk are outdated and do not reflect the current science on mitigating the risk posed by foodborne pathogens such as L. monocytogenes or E. coli O157:H7. In 2009, Health Canada issued a Temporary Marketing Authorization Letter (TMAL)<sup><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn100"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>100</a></sup> to a domestic manufacturer permitting the sale of soft raw milk cheese that does not comply with the storage requirement of the F&amp;DR but is produced according to Québec regulations in order to generate information that will be used to amend the F&amp;DR.<sup><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn101"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>101</a></sup> Also, as a result of an Issue Analysis Summary conducted in 2010, Health Canada has identified a number of elements to be incorporated into a revised policy to manage the risks associated with the consumption of these cheeses. Since some of these elements would require regulatory amendments, Health Canada began stakeholder and expert consultations in 2011. It is expected that pre-publication of the policy intent in the Canada Gazette Part I will occur in 2014.<sup title="reference">250,319,317,321,442,318,323,324,325,326,327,440,441,312,477</sup></p>

<p>Some targeted Program initiatives may be playing a role in reducing exposure to chemical hazards such as those related to benzene in soft drinks,<sup title="reference">19,453,166,192,329</sup> acrylamide in foods,<sup title="reference">138,302,303,7,8</sup> and BPA in food packaging.<sup title="reference">197,21,301,296,193 </sup> In the specific case of acrylamide, once the potential hazard related to acrylamide was communicated through JECFA in early 2002, Health Canada began research into the potential health risk posed by the presence of acrylamide in the food supply and also into the determination of the mechanisms of formation of acrylamide in food. By September of 2002, Health Canada had isolated the major mechanism for the creation of acrylamide and its contributing factors. Following the investigation into the dietary sources of acrylamide in Canada, the article <em>Acrylamide in Foods: Occurrence, Sources, and Modelling</em> was published in the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry in 2002;<sup title="reference">17</sup> and later in 2004, also in a paper entitled <em>Acrylamide in French Fries: Influence of Free Amino Acids and Sugars</em>.<sup title="reference">18</sup> In 2007, acrylamide was identified as a Challenge Chemical under the CMP and added to the List of Toxic Substance in Schedule 1 of the <em>Canadian Environmental Protection Act</em> 1999.<sup title="reference">92</sup> This classification of acrylamide into the CMP resulted in funding to FD for further determination of acrylamide residues in foods that are sold in Canada.<sup title="reference">209</sup> Canada has consequently updated its action response and risk management approach (2009) to acrylamide, which will help reduce Canadians' exposure to acrylamide from food sources, is proposing to add acrylamide to Health Canada's Cosmetic Ingredient Hotlist,<sup title="reference">60 </sup> and has provided recommendations for Canadians on how to reduce acrylamide in foods.

<p>Evidence on the extent of potential exposure to chemical hazards among First Nations who consume traditional foods is being developed for the first time through FNIHB's FSNQ funding. Under FNFNES, a 10-year collaborative initiative started in 2008, a baseline of the modern diets of First Nations as well as the residue in traditional foods is being established for the first time; it is expected that this study will enable the assessment of changes in exposure. Study results to date have helped guide risk assessment and risk communication activities for First Nation communities. FNFNES is the First Nations equivalent to the Total Diet Studies conducted over the past four decades among the general Canadian population but not in First Nation Communities.</p>

<h6>Pesticide Re-evaluation Activities</h6>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>PMRA's pesticide re-evaluation program applies to technical active ingredients as well as to active ingredients in end-use products registered prior to December 31<sup>st</sup>, 1994. The re-evaluation process takes into consideration current scientific assessment methods, regulatory criteria, use patterns of the active ingredients (including incident reports), the diversity of the end-use products, and market penetration. This process also assesses exposure risks to sensitive groups such as children; aggregate exposure from combined dietary, residential and drinking water sources; and, risk of cumulative exposure to chemicals with a common mechanism of toxicity.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>The purpose of the re-evaluation program is to determine if these products remain acceptable for use when assessed against modern scientific standards.<sup title="reference">387</sup> According to <em>Regulatory Directive DIR2001-03</em>, the program intended to review the continued acceptability of 405 active ingredients and their associated end-use products under Section 19 of the <em>Pest Control Products Regulations</em>. This number was later reduced to 401 as four of these active ingredients were disinfectants no longer regulated under the PCPA.<sup title="reference">391,388</sup> The new PCPA (2006) requires that all pesticides be re-evaluated on a 15-year cycle using current scientific and risk assessment standards.<sup title="reference">393</sup></p>

<p>In order to complete<sup><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn109" id="fnb109-ref"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>109</a></sup> the re-evaluations of these active ingredients in a timely manner, make efficient use of the Agency's re-evaluation resources, and maintain a level playing field for trade products treated with pesticides in Canada and the United States, PMRA decided to incorporate foreign reviews into re-evaluations, particularly those conducted by the USEPA, where available and suitable. In particular, because some pesticides are used throughout North America, PMRA worked with USEPA on the re-evaluation of these pesticides through a work sharing and joint review approach. Based on this approach, PMRA had originally intended to complete all re-evaluations by 2006; however, holdups related to changes in the USEPA schedule for conducting re-evaluations and the availability of its reviews led to several delays. Moreover, PMRA experienced other challenges related to the complexity of some assessments, reduced number of alternative products, need for risk management, and transition strategies. According to PMRA, there were 18 pending re-evaluations at the end of March 31<sup>st</sup>, 2012 as shown in <strong>Table 16</strong>.<sup title="reference">338,395,388,389,390,392,393,396,397,398</sup> However, the proportion of food-related pesticides from the total numbers provided in the table was not available.</p>

<h5>Change in Exposure to Nutritional Risks</h5>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>The evaluation was unable to identify conclusive evidence in relation to changes in exposure to nutritional risks (refer to intermediate outcome # 1 for an identification of challenges encountered with available data). Nonetheless, the evaluation was able to identify some initiatives that have effected and may yet effect changes in the exposure to certain nutritional benefits, namely:</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<ul>
<li>Trans fats: 
  <ul>
<li>Canada became the first country in 2003 to require mandatory declaration of trans fatty acid content on the labels of most pre-packaged foods.<sup title="reference">176</sup></li>
<li>According to data collected by Health Canada's two-year Trans Fat Monitoring Program, nutrition labelling regulations were considered an effective motivator for industry to reformulate their products since many had reduced the trans fat content in their products and were meeting the 5% trans fat of total fat content limit, including various ethnic foods.<sup><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn112" id="fnb112-ref"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>112</a></sup>,<sup title="reference">465,467,468,466</sup> </li>
<li>A Canadian study showed that trans fatty acid levels in human milk in Canada have decreased and attributed this trend to Health Canada's labelling requirements leading to reduced exposure to trans fatty acids derived from partial dehydrogenization of vegetable oils.<sup title="reference">112 </sup></li>
<li>A cost-benefit analysis commissioned by Health Canada reported a reduction in the average trans fat intake in Canada across all persons between 2004 and 2008, from approximately 4.9 g/day to 3.4 g/day, respectively.<sup title="reference">137</sup></li>
<li>The same analysis showed that, over a 20-year study period, nutrition labelling regulations would result “in a significant net benefit to Canadian society.”<sup title="reference">137</sup> </li>
</ul> </li>
<li>Food fortification: 
  <ul>
<li>Canada introduced a policy of mandatory fortification of white flour, enriched pasta and cornmeal with folic acid in 1998. Several papers conclude that food fortification with folic acid was associated with a significant reduction in the rate of neural tube defects in Canada.<sup title="reference">77,426,62</sup></li>
</ul> </li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>While these initiatives provide examples of positive changes in exposure to nutritional risk, other risks remain, for example:</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<ul>
<li>Trans fats: 
  <ul>
<li>According to the aforementioned cost-benefit analysis, while nutrition labelling regulations met with some success, 20% to 25% of foods (e.g., pre-packaged baked goods) still contain high trans fat levels and there is a risk of regression, especially in unlabelled products.<sup title="reference">137</sup></li>
<li>While FEAC members have expressed support for “continuing to encourage voluntary reduction efforts and reinstate monitoring of trans fat levels in the Canadian food supply through data gathering, exposure assessment and publication of the findings” to meet the trans fat maximum intake limit recommended by the WHO (1% of total energy intake),<sup title="reference">251,257,258,256</sup> Health Canada has decided to continue pursuing the voluntary reduction approach and rely on alternative methods of data collection, in collaboration with industry, to monitor progress on the reduction of trans fats in Canadians' diets.</li>
</ul> </li>
<li>Sodium: 
  <ul>
<li>According to previously reported data (see intermediate outcome # 1), Canadians' sodium intakes exceed the recommended UL.</li>
<li>During FEAC discussions on the Sodium Reduction Strategy, members have stated that “a tool is needed that will help consumers make informed food choices and address both general and population-specific needs…”<sup title="reference">259</sup> </li>
<li>Canada's health ministers endorsed in 2010 the 2016 interim intake goal of 2,300 mg per day.<sup title="reference">251,256</sup> Health Canada decided in 2010 to rely on FEAC for advice on the government's sodium-reduction plans with the addition of expert members dedicated to this issue.</li>
</ul> </li>

<p><strong>Intermediate Outcome # 3: Increased Adoption of International Standards by Canada and Other Countries</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p><strong>To what extent have international standards been adopted by Canada and other countries?</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p><strong>The Program has processes in place to consider the adoption of international standards. While it was not possible to identify a change in the level of adoption, there is evidence of adherence by Canada to international standards. With respect to adherence by other countries, while this could not be determined it is assumed that membership in international standard setting organizations denotes an interest in harmonization.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>The Program's processes to consider international standards are based on international cooperation approaches and objectives established at the departmental, agency and branch levels (see <strong>Appendix 7</strong>) that focus on:<sup title="reference">161,162,170 </sup></p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<ul>
<li>Exchanging information and conducting collaborative work through bilateral or multilateral working relationships with international regulatory counterparts.</li>
<li>Collaborating with international organizations to set standards and work towards harmonization.</li>
<li>Engaging with countries in the process of developing regulatory systems by building capacity and providing technical assistance to improve harmonization.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>As discussed under immediate outcome # 3, the Program has established a number of international MoUs, agreements, and commitments to strengthen the exchange of knowledge and expertise in order to increase organizational knowledge and enable proper response mechanisms to current and emerging issues.  These arrangements address food regulatory matters of mutual interest with the partner organizations with a focus on a collaborative approach to, among others, policy development and regulatory approaches; surveillance and monitoring systems; emergency response mechanisms; aboriginal health; food safety (chemical and microbial); novel foods and health claims; and, nutrition and food fortification.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>The Program is also active in international fora (e.g., Codex, FAO/WHO, etc.) as well as in direct engagement with international regulatory counterparts (e.g., QUAD meetings, International Microbial Food Safety Liaison Group) to encourage the systematic exchange of information on research, risk assessment, policy development, standard setting, and regulatory and enforcement activities. This is done to address current and emerging food safety issues and facilitate the harmonization of food safety standards, surveillance, monitoring and inspection and certification systems.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>As a result of all these activities, the evaluation identified several examples of adherence by Canada to international standards, namely:</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<ul>
<li>Nutritional labelling: 
  <ul>
<li>Increasing compatibility with the US nutritional labelling system was one of the objectives of the nutrition labelling regulations amending the F&amp;DR in 2003.  As a result, the Canadian and US Nutrition Facts labels have a similar look and format and display the same list of core nutrients.<sup title="reference">431,188</sup></li>
</ul> </li>
<li>Microbial safety: 
  <ul>
<li>Canada is in line with a July 2009 Codex decision related to tolerable levels of L. monocytogenes in RTE foods where a ML (100 cfu/g<sup><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn113" id="fnb113-ref"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>113</a></sup>) was set for certain foods where the bacteria cannot grow. In RTE products where growth is possible (e.g., raw milk cheese), no L. monocytogenes will be allowed (zero tolerance).<sup title="reference">463 </sup></li>
</ul> </li>
<li>Chemical safety: 
  <ul>
<li>Health Canada agreed with JECFA's recommendations to reduce exposure to acrylamide. Health Canada has decided to coordinate its risk management efforts for acrylamide in food with key food regulatory partners in Australia, Europe, Japan, New Zealand and the US.<sup title="reference">138</sup></li>
<li>Health Canada continues to work with the international community in the study of acrylamide through participation in JECFA.<sup title="reference">490</sup> </li>
<li>Health Canada's scientific assessments of food additive and packaging material submissions align with the risk analysis principles developed by the WHO/FAO.<sup title="reference">101</sup></li>
</ul> </li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>The evaluation identified cases when Canada has been unable to adhere to international standards due to issues related to the lengthy regulatory approval process or concerns with international approaches that may not fully reflect the Program's position (emanating from scientific and policy considerations). An example of this has been the approval of asparaginase as a food processing aid to reduce the formation of acrylamide in food. While Canada identified the major mechanism for the creation of acrylamide and its contributing factors in 2002, Health Canada only concluded the public consultation process relating to the proposal to amend the F&amp;DR to permit the use of asparaginase in certain foods in 2010,<sup title="reference">210</sup> and amended the F&amp;DR as a result of these consultations.<sup title="reference">432</sup> Health Canada then revised its exposure assessment of acrylamide in food in 2012.<sup><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn114" id="fnb114-ref"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>114</a></sup>,<sup title="reference">303</sup> Conversely, asparaginase was permitted for use in foods years earlier in the US, Australia, New Zealand and Denmark while also receiving a favourable evaluation by JECFA.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>On the issue of adherence to international standards by other countries, membership in international standard setting organizations (e.g., Codex) denotes an interest in international collaborative work and eventual harmonization, albeit the presence of similar limitations as those experienced by Canada. It is expected that the adoption of Codex standards and related texts, especially by developing countries, will lead to improved food safety worldwide and greater assurance by Canadian regulators that foods imported into Canada from these countries will comply with regulatory requirements. </p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p><strong>Intermediate Outcome # 4: More Integrated Approach to F/P/T Food Safety and Nutrition Priorities and Activities</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p><strong>To what extent has the Program increased the integration of FSNQ priorities and activities?</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p><strong>The Program collaborates with F/P/T partners and stakeholders through a number of committees and initiatives. While there is some satisfaction with this approach, there are some concerns related to communications among key Program participants and between the Program and its P/T partners (e.g., on HRAs, FSAs, roles and responsibilities) and its stakeholders (e.g., information consolidation and transparency). </strong></p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>As discussed under immediate outcome # 5, key Program participants collaborate with one another as well as with F/P/T partners and stakeholders through a large number of committees and numerous initiatives. The Program uses this multipronged approach to exchange information, foster dialogue, consult, and coordinate priorities and risk management approaches.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>Some evaluation interviewees viewed this approach as appropriate as they indicated that there were no areas of duplication at the federal level with roles and responsibilities clearly defined. The existence of MoUs (e.g., between Health Canada, the Public Health Agency of Canada and CFIA<sup title="reference">362,363 </sup>) was seen as an effective way of providing a clear definition of roles and responsibilities. With respect to F/P/T interaction, some evaluation interviewees saw no duplication or overlap since, while some responsibilities were shared, roles were viewed as complementary. This was aided by the existence of protocols, fora and systems used to ensure coordination among jurisdictions and to provide a consistent approach to common issues. </p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>Nonetheless, some evaluation interviewees also identified specific concerns related to the effectiveness of communications among key Program participants and between the Program and its P/T partners, namely:</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<ul>
<li>Lingering uncertainty among P/T government representatives on the roles of Health Canada and CFIA as they relate to HRA preparation.</li>
<li>Inadequate communications and agreement on priority settings between BFSA and CFIA on the issue of FSAs.</li>
<li>Limited integrated strategic planning and engagement with AAFC.</li>
<li>Need for improved understanding by P/T partners of the functions, and their limits, between federal and P/T governments as well as the lead role played by each organization (e.g., on food regulation related to additives, labelling, nutritional quality and trans fats).</li>
<li>Lack of clarity among emergency response partners and stakeholders on the role of systems (e.g., PulseNet), the role of F/P/T parties (especially in communications with the public), and the role of laboratories (NML and BMH laboratories).</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>It is expected that some of these concerns will be addressed through recent developments, namely: </p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<ul>
<li>F/P/T health ministers have identified the need for the Health and Agriculture portfolios to collaborate in order to have a more integrated Canadian food safety system.<sup title="reference">133</sup></li>

</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<ul>
<li>Seemingly uncoordinated approach to the production and dissemination of consumer information by key Program participants.</li>
<li>Need for improved, more structured public communications regarding Program information on areas being addressed, on work being conducted (e.g., on relevant issues such as sodium) and on primary roles (i.e., Health Canada, the Public Health Agency of Canada and CFIA).</li>

According to data previously presented under intermediate outcome # 1 and other recent data from Health Canada presented here below<sup title="reference">287,288,289</sup> it appears that there are a number of nutritional concerns among the Canadian population in general:</p>

<li>Children's diets provide adequate amounts of most vitamins and minerals, with the exception of vitamin D and calcium (4 - 8 years only). </li>
<li>For nutrients with an Adequate Intake (AI),<sup><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn118" id="fnb118-ref"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>118</a></sup> there is concern that children may not be meeting their needs for potassium and fibre. </li>

Changes in BMI (underweight, overweight and obesity<sup><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn122" id="fnb122-ref"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>122</a></sup>) can be the result of poor nutrition among other factors such as health behaviours (eating habits and daily physical activity), and broader social, environmental and biological determinants that influence these behaviours. According to CCHS data,<sup title="reference">449</sup> the number of overweight Canadians aged 18 years and over has remained relatively consistent over the last 10 years.

<p>The evaluation identified numerous approaches used by the Program to engage partners and stakeholders in an effort to communicate, collaborate and integrate multiple perspectives (see immediate outcome # 5 and intermediate outcome # 4); these include committees integrated by F/P/T representatives as well as stakeholders, policy and regulatory development initiatives, workshops, bilateral/multi-agency meetings, and consultations to name a few.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>Evaluation interviewees expressed some satisfaction with Program efforts on collaboration and consultation, and it is expected that ongoing efforts to engage food safety partners will continue to enhance opportunities for consultation and collaboration (e.g., through SCDH and CFS, FEAC and Food Supply Chain Stakeholder meetings as well as ongoing consultations on regulatory modernization). It is also expected that FCSAP, through its focus on consultation and communication with industry and Canadians as part of its active prevention strategies, will contribute to these efforts. Nonetheless, the results of all these initiatives will have to be assessed to determine their level of success.</p>

<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>The evaluation identified a number of issues affecting collaboration in the FSA process leading to delays and difficulties in planning and priority setting. FSAP began a reassessment process in 2010. As of October 2013, CFIA has joined the Health Portfolio.

<h5>Level of Inclusion of the Results from Consultation into Policies, Standards and Regulatory Decisions</h5>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>The <em>Cabinet Directive on Streamlining Regulation </em>(2007)<sup title="reference">27 </sup> as well as the more recent <em>Cabinet Directive on Regulatory Management</em> (2012)<sup title="reference">26 </sup> state that, when regulating, the federal government will “create accessible, understandable, and responsive regulation through … transparency, accountability, and public scrutiny” and “require timeliness, policy coherence, and minimal duplication throughout the regulatory process by consulting, coordinating, and cooperating across the federal government, with other governments [and jurisdictions] in Canada and abroad, and with businesses and Canadians.”  The evaluation identified a number of guidelines, standards, frameworks and policies in high priority areas that had been impacted or developed as a result of advancement in scientific and regulatory research as well as consultation (see immediate outcome # 4).</p>

<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<h5>Level of Responsiveness of the Regulatory Framework</h5>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>The level of responsiveness of the regulatory framework for FSNQ has been challenged for a number of years:</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<ul>
<li>As early as 1999, an industry opinion article in a Canadian food trade journal indicated the need for a fast track approval process to introduce products into the marketplace claiming that Europe, Japan and the US were well ahead of Canada in product introduction procedural rules.<sup title="reference">87</sup></li>
<li><em>A review of Canadian food safety policy and its effectiveness in addressing health risks for Canadians</em> (2002) found that food safety regulations were having difficulties keeping pace with many of the new developments, especially because the risk assessment approach cannot properly identify and address non-acute hazards. The approach was found to not properly weigh the benefits of new technologies or compare their performance to other approaches in an effort to mitigate hazards.<sup title="reference">356</sup></li>
<li>A 2006 Food and Consumer Products of Canada report identified four key challenges with the regulatory environment in Canada:<sup title="reference">99</sup>
<ul>
<li>“Approval times routinely take three to five years because of a cumbersome system for regulatory change. Some approvals never happen at all.</li>
<li>Small regulatory differences between Canada and our largest trading partner prevent Canadian-based companies from competing for North American product mandates.</li>
<li>Lack of capacity and responsiveness within Health Canada means that proactive policies, such as food fortification and health claims, take years to be addressed.</li>
<li>Regulation is a very significant determinant of economic performance and competitiveness. The food industry's key economic indicators show some troubling trends.”</li>
</ul> </li>
<li>A trade journal article on novel fibre development in 2007 indicated the need for a shorter lag time for marketplace introduction. The article cited examples where Canadian new fibre products were accepted by and introduced into the US 10 years before Canadian approval was given. The trade article suggested that Health Canada needed to keep pace with the rest of the world in its regulatory approval process.<sup title="reference">98</sup></li>
<li>A 2008 Food and Consumer Products of Canada report on Canada's regulatory system concluded that:<sup title="reference">100</sup>
<ul>
<li>Canada was not competitive and that its food regulatory system was behind those of world leading nations.</li>
<li>Canada's lagging system had very high costs.</li>
<li>Canada's regulatory system needed to be modernized.</li>
<li>Lack of commercialization opportunity was fuelling the decline of the sector.</li>
<li>There was no evidence to link the lags to measures to help improve the health and safety of Canadians.</li>
</ul> </li>
<li>A 2008 report on 12 case studies estimated the costs incurred by food companies (i.e., “direct costs, opportunity costs to the food manufacturing companies looking to develop new food products and/or market products with health claims, potential lost sales for retailers because of lack of product availability and potential lost sales for primary producers”) at more than $440 million in view of lags stemming from the current regulatory regime and linked to “poor administrative processes and lack of a framework for decision-making.”<sup title="reference">100</sup></li>
<li>The report <em>Canadian food regulatory outlook 2008 - 2009</em> (2009) comments on the lack of progress on allergen labelling and organics and identifies policies on food fortification as too rigid.<sup title="reference">121</sup></li>
<li>A 2011 survey on Canadians' awareness, attitudes and behaviours with respect to food safety (n<sub>1</sub>=1,003, n<sub>2</sub>=1,001, n<sub>focus groups</sub>~36) reported that while 89% of Canadians were at a minimum moderately confident in the food system, there were concerns that it was over-burdened.<sup title="reference">343</sup></li>
<li>According to FCSAP, “food-borne illness outbreaks, major food recalls and increased consumer and media interest in import product safety have raised questions around the integrity of food safety systems in Canada and abroad.”<sup><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn131" id="fnb131-ref"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>131</a></sup></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>Many evaluation interviewees considered the F&amp;DA and F&amp;DR as non-responsive and outdated. They saw the F&amp;DR as either too prescriptive or unclear, which sometimes required legal interpretation that led to many exceptions and exemptions as well as to a lack of coherence among key Program participants (e.g., between Health Canada and CFIA). Interviewees also believed that the F&amp;DR did not reflect market advances due, in part, to a lengthy amendment process (e.g., publishing in Canada Gazette Parts I and II may take two or five years) that precluded regulations from keeping up with scientific progress, thus making them obsolete. </p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>On the regulatory amendment process, interviewees further clarified that some regulatory proposals do not move forward or the amendment process takes too long (e.g., food fortification, pasteurized fruit juices, food irradiation, allergens, labelling, health claims, additives and IMAs to mention a few) due to several factors:</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<ul>
<li>Resource issues, especially lack of legal resources.</li>
<li>Legislative renewal no longer being active causing many proposals to be re-started.</li>
<li>A lack of internal understanding of the regulatory process (i.e., one project may lead to many amendments).</li>
<li>A focus on low-impact issues, which compete for resources with larger-impact issues.</li>
<li>Political concerns.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>Interviewees also believed that the lengthy regulatory modernization was perpetuating a lack of clarity in the regulatory framework. In some cases, this situation seemed to be leading industry to find other ways to move their concerns forward (e.g., food industry submissions being submitted or re-submitted for pre-market assessment as a Natural Health Product [NHP]). This was not only affecting industry but was causing enforcement challenges.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>For its part, the Program has committed to address several of the above challenges through a number of strategies, initiatives and regulatory changes aimed at modernizing the system, for example:</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<ul>
<li>One of the objectives of the Blueprint for Renewal was: “Health Canada will design and implement a modern, efficient and responsive food regulatory framework that protects and promotes human health, responds to emerging food safety and nutrition challenges, and minimizes unnecessary delays in bringing safe food and food products to the Canadian marketplace.”<sup title="reference">175</sup></li>
<li>One of the strategies in HPFB's 2007-2008 Business Plan and HPFB's Roadmap for 2007-2012 was identified as: “Promote health through a modernized food regulatory system and a proactive approach to nutrition.”<sup title="reference">174,172</sup></li>
<li>Health Canada's Regulatory Modernization Strategy for Food and Nutrition identified five goals, namely:<sup title="reference">191</sup>
<ul>
<li>“Improving predictability, effectiveness, efficiency, and transparency in Health Canada's food regulatory system.</li>
<li>Promoting regulatory responsiveness to food innovation and promoting consumer access to foods with assessed health benefits.</li>
<li>Modernizing the regulatory toolkit to address 'food contributors' to chronic disease.</li>
<li>Improving Health Canada's responsiveness to acute food safety health risks - responding to new threats while managing on-going risks.”</li>
</ul> </li>
<li>FCSAP is “...composed of a series of initiatives to modernize and strengthen Canada's safety system for food, health and consumer products.” With respect to food safety system modernization, FCSAP notes that the system “...needs to provide 'new and better information on food risks in the Canadian marketplace, and involve industry and Canadians to address those risks.'” Further, the Plan recognizes the need to enhance policies, standards and processes as well as collaborate with international partners, to strengthen the prevention of food safety issues.”<sup title="reference">191</sup>
<ul>
<li>However, FCSAP's Results-Based Management and Accountability Framework is not exhaustive on measures related to efficiency, transparency and predictability. It identifies only the following two indicators under the outcome “improved potential for more timely availability of food that meets expected standards:” “% and range of new submissions addressed within time standards” and “research in policy and [regulatory impact analysis statements].”<sup title="reference">127</sup></li>
<li>It is expected that recent amendments (2012) to the F&amp;DA introducing a new Marketing Authorization framework and a new Incorporation by Reference authority will grant Health Canada the ability to address some of these concerns. The new Marketing Authorization framework will allow faster regulatory approval of substances (e.g., food additives) and claims used in or on food and food labels, while Incorporation by Reference will permit broader referencing of internally and externally generated documents on a static or ambulatory basis as part of the regulations in order to shorten the regulatory amendment process involved in updating lists included in the F&amp;DR (e.g., food additives, maximum limits for chemical contaminants, etc.).<sup title="reference">12,425</sup></li>
</ul> </li>
<li>Recent approval (2012) of Bill S-11: <em>Safe Food for Canadians Act</em>, with its focus on prevention, increased traceability and imported foods, will address some of the concerns related to surveillance and monitoring measures.<sup title="reference">31</sup></li>

<h3 id="a45">4.5 Performance: Issue # 5 - Demonstration of Efficiency and Economy</h3>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p><strong>Have alternate delivery structures been considered as part of Program implementation and delivery? Has the Program designed and implemented a Performance Measurement Strategy? Has the budget allocated to the Program and its expenditures been suitable for the Program to achieve its outcomes?</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p><strong>Program performance and financial information was insufficient to properly demonstrate efficiency and economy. There are a number of Program areas where performance issues may be affecting efficiency. Potential alternative delivery structures focussed on resource sharing (e.g., partnerships, outsourcing, and cost recovery) may contribute to efficiency improvement if fully implemented.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>The Treasury Board of Canada's <em>Directive on the Evaluation Function </em>(2009) and guidance regarding <em>Assessing Program Resource Utilization When Evaluating Federal Programs</em> (2013) define the demonstration of economy and efficiency as “an assessment of resource utilization in relation to the production of outputs and progress toward expected outcomes.”<sup title="reference">81,53</sup> This assessment is based on the assumption that departments and agencies have standardized performance measurement systems and that financial systems link information about Program costs to specific inputs, activities, outputs and expected results.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>The data structure of the detailed financial information provided for the Program did not facilitate the assessment of whether Program outputs were produced efficiently, or whether expected outcomes were produced economically. Specifically, the lack of output/outcome-specific costing data limited the ability to use cost-comparative approaches. In terms of assessing economy, challenges in tracking funding within the broader Program envelope limited the assessment. Considering these issues, the evaluation provides observations on economy and efficiency based on findings from the document review, a case study on similar FSNQ programs in other countries, interviews and available financial data.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<h4>Observations on Efficiency</h4>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>Findings previously discussed under each of the evaluation outcomes have identified a number of issues that may impact efficiency in various areas of the Program. Due to insufficient data on inputs (e.g., FTEs and budget) allocated to these areas, it is only possible to assess these areas of concern based on general observations on performance, namely:</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<ul>
<li>Pre-market submissions: 
  <ul>
<li>Submission assessments are not meeting the regulated time standards and available data indicates an increase in the number of submissions awaiting completion. The volumes of some types of submissions have risen considerably (e.g., food packaging material from 2,035 submissions at end of FY 2011-2012 to 3,186 at end of FY 2012-2013). Many submission assessments have been awaiting completion for several years. It is not yet known how recent changes implemented by FD will affect these trends.</li>
</ul> </li>
<li>HRAs: 
  <ul>
<li>While HRAs conducted in response to CFIA requests are being completed according to established standards, some concerns remain that could affect future efficiency (e.g., IT infrastructure challenges, largely paper-based process).</li>
</ul> </li>
<li>Communications: 
  <ul>
<li>Communication products and engagement activities lack impact assessments that would allow the Program to determine the success of these efforts and, thus, any efficiency gains or losses. This is particularly relevant in the case of Health Canada's large online presence.</li>
</ul> </li>
<li>Regulations: 
  <ul>
<li>The lengthy regulatory amendment process may be affecting Program and industry performance (e.g., regulatory amendments on food processing aids) and may be exacerbated by a lack of human resources.</li>
<li>Evaluation interviewees noted that some regulatory proposals do not move forward or the amendment process takes too long (e.g., food fortification, pasteurized fruit juices, food irradiation, allergens, labelling, health claims, additives and IMAs to mention a few) due to several factors (e.g., limited human resources).</li>
</ul> </li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>The evaluation examined alternate delivery structures through consultation with Program personnel as well as a comparative case study on similar programs in other jurisdictions. The following sub-sections identify lessons learned in this area.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<h5>Organizational Restructuring</h5>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>Among the countries examined as part of the case study on FSNQ programs in selected countries (i.e., Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the UK and the US), all except the US had undergone a restructuring of their food safety systems during the period of this evaluation. The reasons for re-organization varied by country and included various combinations of the following factors: streamlining inefficient systems, reducing activity duplication/overlap, lowering costs, and/or restoring public confidence. These restructuring processes resulted in two approaches to program implementation: 1) a plural approach with multiple organizations playing specific and complementary roles such as that of Canada, the UK (e.g., UKFSA, the UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs [UKDEFRA] and the UK Health and Safety Executive [UKHSE]) and the US (e.g., USFDA, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [USCDC] and USEPA); and, 2) a consolidated approach where most or all functions are concentrated in a single organization or agency (e.g., FSANZ and the New Zealand Food Safety Authority). In all cases, except for New Zealand, pesticides are administered by separate agencies or authorities (i.e., PMRA, the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority, UKHSE, and USEPA).</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>In the case of all countries involved in system restructuring (including Canada), the restructuring processes were mirrored in changes to regulatory systems, which led to a division of risk assessment and risk management functions. However, there is little documented evidence on how this separation has affected the efficiency of policy development, risk assessment and risk management groups; specifically, how these groups have adjusted and maintained connections with each other and with frontline events. A report by the US Government Accountability Office entitled <em>Experiences of Seven Countries in Consolidating Their Food Safety Systems</em> (2005) (including Canada, New Zealand and the UK), stated that “none of the countries has conducted an analysis to compare the effectiveness and efficiency of its consolidated food safety system with that of the previous system.”<sup title="reference">482</sup></p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<h5>Public-Private Partnerships</h5>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>Generally, research partnerships between key Program participants and other sectors, such as academia or industry, are limited or non-existent. The Program does not use grants to encourage research in areas of interest as done by other regulatory counterparts.<sup><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn132" id="fnb132-ref"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>132</a></sup> Some FD interviewees stated that there were no partnerships due to the different purposes between government and academic or industry research. They also viewed collaboration with academia as costly while limiting the uses of the results, probably due to intellectual property rights. Some FNIHB interviewees identified opportunities where partnership had been sought and delivered successful results (e.g., work related to the Food Mail Program, and the Nutrition North Canada Program that replaced it, and LifeLine). Finally, a few Public Health Agency of Canada interviewees stated that there was a push for partnerships in research but that it was hard to implement and there were also concerns with losing scientific expertise in the Agency.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<h5>In-House vs. External Research</h5>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>The level of research outsourcing varies among key Program participants. FD conducts little outsourcing since there is a lack of financial resources allocated to outsourcing work and associated expenses (e.g., Request for Proposal preparation, proposal review, and travel time as expertise tends to be found outside the National Capital Region); there is a perceived lack of viability since the necessary multidisciplinary expertise for certain projects cannot be found among academia or industry; and, there are apparent risks related to credibility (competency of contractor) and confidentiality.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<h5>Cost Recovery</h5>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>The majority of Program activities are not cost recovered. An examination of similar programs in other countries identified the following:</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<ul>
<li>Australia, New Zealand, the UK and the US charge fees for assessing certain pre-market food submissions from the food industry. The reasons for cost recovery are linked to submission complexity (e.g., food additives, novel foods), potential commercial gain by the applicant upon submission approval, or desire by the applicant to fast track the submission process.</li>
<li>Food safety activities related to surveillance and outbreaks are not cost recovered by any country.</li>
<li>Pesticide-related activities (e.g., assessment of submissions, granting licences and annual renewal) are cost recovered by all countries.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>A comparison of cost-recovered activities between Canada's FSNQP and its counterparts in Australia, New Zealand, the UK and the US is provided in <strong>Appendix 8</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>According to some evaluation interviewees, there have been discussions on implementing cost recovery for pre-market food submission assessments; however, the process has not moved forward as a result of several concerns. One concern is related to the lack of market exclusivity (via patents) for the majority of food submissions, which is considered to be a significant difference between foods and health products or pesticides. In this case, it is believed that cost recovery could represent a significant disincentive for industry to file submissions; however, several of the submissions are mandatory, thus giving the applicant no option but to file. Further, the use of patents in the food industry to protect innovation and, thus, differentiate foods or packages based on technological advantages that could benignly affect human health is not uncommon (there are a number of food process and packaging patents in the US addressing antimicrobial protection and improved food texturing<sup title="reference">472</sup>).</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>A 2011 report assessing food packaging innovation found that companies are continuously innovating to address consumer concerns (e.g., tamper-evident packaging and interactive packages that use radio frequency identification technology to track food from source to destination).<sup title="reference">76</sup> A 2009 report on patents and health claims related to functional foods<sup><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn133" id="fnb133-ref"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>133</a></sup> found that “patenting a formulation or a process for creating a functional food may exclude others from selling the formulation, or from using the process. The technology can also be licensed out, enabling the inventor(s) to make money from it.”<sup title="reference">470</sup> A 2009 article on functional foods conducted a search of patent collections in Europe, Japan, the US and the World, or Patent Cooperative Treaty offices; the article identified “approximately 3,900 patents and applications pertaining to health foods, functional foods or 'foods for wellness'” with approximately half of these patents classified as A23L: “foods...not covered by other subclasses: their preparation or treatment.”<sup title="reference">471</sup></p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<h4>Observations on the Adequacy and Use of Performance Measurement Data</h4>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>Overall, the performance measurement data available for the evaluation was of limited use in addressing the achievement of the identified outcomes. The collection of performance data does not appear to be consistent, there are a variety of measures and formats used, there is no Program approach to data collection and analysis, and efforts tend to focus on tracking mainly Program outputs. Examples include: </p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<ul>
<li>A Performance and Accountability Framework for the Program was developed in 1999.<sup><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn134" id="fnb134-ref"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>134</a></sup> This framework described activities, outputs, reach as well as short- and long-term outcomes related to FD, FNIHB, PMRA and the Public Health Agency of Canada together with a short list of general indicators. A second framework was developed in 2000<sup><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn135" id="fnb135-ref"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>135</a></sup> that described activities, outputs, reach as well as short- and long-term outcomes related to FD and the Public Health Agency of Canada only. Each key Program participant has also developed its own Performance Measurement Strategy but these strategies have not been developed with a Program view.</li>
<li>As of 2005, departmental and Agency data used for preparing RPPs and Departmental Performance Reports (DPRs) was to originate through a more structured approach through the development of Management, Resources and Results Structures (MRRS),<sup><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn136" id="fnb136-ref"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>136</a></sup> which provide a template to capture performance information according to PAA level. While Health Canada had developed its MRRS, the systematic creation, collection, capture and use of information only began in FY 2007-2008.<sup title="reference">310</sup> The Public Health Agency of Canada had a MRRS approved by Treasury Board in 2009.<sup title="reference">414</sup> The indicators used are too high level to address evaluation needs.</li>
<li>Departments, branches and agencies have also developed a series of annual, operational and business plans that provide performance information. Some key Program participants (e.g., FD) have produced performance reports but not on a regular basis. FD reports examined covering FY 2009-2010 to 2012-2013 show a variety of performance measures and reporting formats used on a quarterly and annual basis making temporal comparisons difficult if not impossible.<sup title="reference">205,221,222,270,262,297,292,290,225,226,227,266,269,285,228</sup> </li>
<li>FD uses the Program Management Reporting System (PMRS) as a tool for managing project work (e.g., planning and resource allocation). PMRS is used to support quarterly reporting on priorities to the ADM and provides information for RPPs, DPRs and other operational reviews. However, while some projects contain performance indicators, this is not a common approach; thus, the usefulness of PMRS as a performance measurement tool is limited by lack of performance data.</li>
<li>FD has also developed a performance measurement best practices manual<sup title="reference">308 </sup> and a <em>Food Directorate Performance Measurement System </em>based on a logic model approach.<sup title="reference">164</sup> The system contains project-based logic models and associated activities and performance indicators on specific topic areas such as special purpose foods, allergens, and novel foods. However, although prototyped in 2002 and launched in 2005-2006, with an intention to link it to PMRS, the system is not being used due to decisions associated with changes in reporting processes at HPFB and departmental levels.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>Some FD interviewees believed that, although some of these tools were available and useful as planning tools, measuring policy effectiveness needed to be addressed. They elaborated that monitoring the impacts of policy (e.g., behaviour change) was complicated by the inability to conduct public opinion research, which was deemed essential to assess the impacts on the health of Canadians and measure progress on Program outcomes. Some FD interviewees also believed that performance measurement activity was seen as a lower priority and that FD had no clear strategic plan for this activity. They mentioned that although data elements were identified, data was not regularly collected. Moreover, some interviewees mentioned that performance measurement responsibility was given to FD Bureaux whose staff lacked performance measurement expertise.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>FD interviewees stated that indicators used in PMRS were mostly focused on outputs, which, while useful for planning purposes, provided an insufficient measure of level of quality (e.g., quality of the reviews vs. number of pre-market submissions processed). This sentiment was echoed by other Program interviewees, who believed that it was not possible to assess the effectiveness of the Program as this was not monitored through performance measurement indicators (e.g., indicators seeking to measure the impact of decisions made, actions taken and concomitant changes, level of integration of all activities, level of reporting according to key commitments and achievements, level of transparency/communication, etc.).</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>Recent efforts to employ a Program approach to reporting, such as the response to the <em>Weatherill Repor</em>t (2009), and efforts to link key commitments to performance indicators to outcomes, as proposed by Health Canada'sFood and Nutrition Safety Program strategic plans,<sup title="reference">305,291</sup> may help to improve performance measurement data collection and analysis.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<h4>Observations on Economy</h4>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>Budgetary and expenditure data available was insufficient to permit an economic assessment of the Program. The evaluation identified a number of issues affecting the quality and availability of data:</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<ul>
<li>As noted earlier, the Program experienced several organizational changes during the 2000-2004 period (and some beyond) that led to a transfer of funds between organizations. These changes included: 
  <ul>
<li>The creation of three new branches, namely HPFB, FNIHB and RAPB,<sup><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn137" id="fnb137-ref"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>137</a></sup> through realignment of the Health Protection Branch (HPB), the Medical Services Branch, and the Health Promotion and Programs Branch.</li>
<li>The creation of the Public Health Agency of Canada with the concomitant transfer of functions from HPB/HPFB (i.e., the Laboratory Centre for Disease Control, the functions of which now reside within CFEZID) and the Population and Public Health Branch (i.e., the Centre for Surveillance Coordination, now the Surveillance Coordination Unit within the Office of Public Health Practice) to this new Agency.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>PAAs examined changed considerably over the evaluation period. For example, in the case of Health Canada, PAAs developed for FY 2007-2008 and earlier were designed to report on sub-Activities and sub-sub-Activities that reflected Program functional activities (e.g., sub-Activity: pre-market regulatory evaluation &amp; process improvement, sub-sub-Activity: approval times). Conversely, PAAs used since FY 2008-2009 have been designed to report on sub-Activities and sub-sub-Activities that reflect Programs and their component Directorates (e.g., sub-Activity: food safety and nutrition, sub-sub-activity: food-borne pathogens). It was not possible to link financial data between these two periods or to align it with the logic model developed for the evaluation.</li>
<li>In the case of Health Canada, departmental government-wide reduction exercises of previous years were cash-managed at the branch level and funded by branch surpluses at year end. These transactions were not attributed to any specific sub-Program according to the PAA. Also, interpretative information that would explain decisions made in annual budget derivations and reasons for transactions was not available.</li>
<li>SAP data examined was inconsistently coded or had missing information in some fields. For example, an examination of FD functional area codes showed inconsistencies across FYs and in grouping structures (PAA-based). An analysis of SAP internal order (IO) numbers covering FY 1999-2000 to 2007-2008 to link with data reported in PMRS showed 32% of records missing an IO/project number.<sup><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn138" id="fnb138-ref"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>138</a></sup> Although the IO field exists in SAP, HPFB has stated that it is not a mandatory field in the coding block and, therefore, not required when incurring expenditures and commitments.</li>
<li>While the Program is financed through dedicated funding requests (i.e., resources requested to address specific objectives) and through core funding (i.e., funding allocated by departments, branches and agencies to allow the Program to carry out its everyday activities), these sources were difficult to identify and track in the available data (e.g., derivations). The level of detail available from dedicated funding requests varies and is inconsistent across all the documents examined (e.g., in many cases, while multiple activities are identified in the documents, funding tables do not allocate monies on an activity basis). Funding received through these dedicated requests is presented in <strong>Table 18</strong>.<sup><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn139" id="fnb139-ref"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>139</a></sup> According to this data, the Program was granted approximately $553 million in dedicated funding during FY 1999-2000 to 2011-2012. According to HPFB, “funding source” is not a mandatory field in the coding structures; however, cost centre (organization), G/L (type of expenditure) and Functional Area (FA, which is the lowest level of the PAA structure) related to activity/Program area are tracked.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>Moving forward, HPFB plans to make use of IO numbers to capture financial information on Program delivery, which will enable a better separation of reporting elements/components to link sources of funding with Program expenditures. According to HPFB, separate IO numbers have been created for all funding earmarked through dedicated funding requests; however, the majority of IO numbers are related to A-base funding and other initiatives, which the Directorates or the Program may want to track for various reasons. Once the requirement to track the earmarked funds is lifted, the funds/expenditures may be combined with A-base as deemed appropriate by HPFB. HPFB has also recently introduced financial management controls, including an improved time tracking system, to help validate costing. The plans of other key Program participants to address financial tracking deficiencies are unknown.</p>

<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<h5>The Program continues to address a demonstrable need.</h5>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>The activities carried out by the Program are designed to address known and emerging issues related to FSNQ (e.g., microbial and chemical food safety hazards, emergent and re-emergent pathogens, new technologies, dietary needs). On-going scientific developments, market changes, and evolving consumer preferences, among others, will continue to present FSNQ challenges, which the Program is in the best position to address.</p>

<h5>The Program is aligned with government priorities.</h5>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>Speeches from the Throne over the years have recognized the importance of FSNQ and identified federal priorities aimed at strengthening Canada's food safety system and ensuring nutrition quality. The Program seeks to address these federal priorities through an inclusive approach reflected in relevant Program planning documents, which has as its goal the risk-based identification and prioritization of issues. Program objectives are aligned with relevant strategic outcomes from Health Canada and the Public Health Agency of Canada.</p>

<p>The Program operates within a legislative framework designed to address priorities through policy development and standard setting, health promotion activities, risk and disease prevention, disease investigation, research and monitoring as well as national and international cooperation, among others. Relevant Acts identify roles and responsibilities that enable key Program participants to operate within the established federal parameters. The Program acts as the umbrella under which federal activities related to the FSNQ are managed. These activities are not duplicated by any other federal program.</p>

<p><strong>Immediate Outcome # 1: Increased Availability of Safe and Nutritious Foods for Canadians</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p><strong>While Canadian food safety performance is high, issues of timeliness, in particular with respect to pre-market submission reviews, may be delaying the entry of foods into the market.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>FD assesses pre-market submissions according to regulatory requirements to help ensure that the food product is safe. Overall, pre-market submission assessments are not meeting the regulated time standards (61% increase between FY 2007-2008 and 2012-2013) while some volumes (novel food and food additive) declined between FY 2011-2012 and the third quarter of 2012-2013. During this last period, submissions without regulated time standards saw an increase in some volumes (food packaging and food processing aids) and a decrease in others (incidental additive). FD uses a collaborative approach to submission assessment; however, the evaluation identified several issues contributing to the submission review backlog. Among these, outstanding petitioner information as well as timeliness and communications with respect to the submissions review process are of particular concern to industry stakeholders and contribute to delays.</p>

<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>Some of the delays experienced may be linked to the lengthy regulatory approval/amendment process, while others may be linked to industry's desire to obtain FD's LONOs (documents issued by Health Canada which can be used by the food seller to assure its customers that the products have been evaluated by FD and deemed acceptable). LONOs may be issued by Health Canada for those submissions that do not require a pre-market assessment (e.g., food packaging materials and food processing aids). While FD has been taking steps since 2007 to address the submission review backlog (e.g., establishment of a Submission Management Unit and an Internal Committee on Submission Governance to move forward the authorization of food applications where regulatory amendments were pending), the level of success of these initiatives appears limited as the backlog has continued to increase. Without further evidence, an accurate assessment on the level of success of these initiatives is not possible.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>HRAs are developed to determine if the presence of a certain substance or micro-organism in food poses a health risk to consumers. FD reports 100% compliance with delivering HRAs within service standards to CFIA; however, the number of completed HRAs reported by FD in different documents is inconsistent. According to trend analysis data, L. monocytogenes and “meat and poultry” were involved in approximately half of the microbial HRAs conducted during FYs 2008-2009 and 2010-2011. The same analysis points to an increase in CFIA requests for technical advice, which combined with existing FD challenges related to HRA preparation (e.g., lack of suitable IT infrastructure, absence of a single repository of information across the Directorate) may put pressure on future performance. Efforts by FD are underway to better track and analyze data stemming from HRA activity (e.g., trends in HRA requests, linking food safety incidents to HRAs) and to expand capacity (e.g., additional hires, training/cross-training, facility enhancements) in an effort to maintain performance.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p><strong>Immediate Outcome # 2: Increased Awareness and Understanding of Food Safety- and Nutrition-Related Risks and Health Benefits</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p><strong>Changes in awareness and understanding were difficult to assess since the Program does not measure uptake of the information it produces. There are areas where further information or education is needed to improve consumer understanding. Some information delivery mechanisms may not be as effective in relaying information to the intended targets/populations.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>The impact of the Program's products and activities on public awareness and understanding cannot be determined since the Program does not measure or track uptake by audience and time period. An exception and best practice was the Listeria social marketing strategy, which included targeted communications, multiple delivery mechanism, and a survey to collect impact data. A key challenge to understanding impact is a lack of alignment between delivery mechanism and target population preferences. For example, while some sub-populations may be more inclined to access food safety information online (e.g., pregnant women and parents in general), others may be more comfortable with traditional print media (e.g., seniors); still others may experience limited access to online resources or access to the required peripherals (e.g., First Nations and Inuit communities in remote locations). This limited “information tailoring” may negatively impact awareness and understanding by reducing communication effectiveness and contributing to uneven public awareness and understanding.  In particular, the Program's focus on a large online presence may be challenged based on current Web statistics (e.g., low volume of visits and views of Health Canada's food safety Web pages according to FD Web statistics). Some of the areas where further information or education is needed include food safety, nutrition and healthy eating, nutrition labelling, trans fats, and GM foods. In general, being aware of the information may not be translating into changing dietary behaviour.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p><strong>Immediate Outcome # 3: Enhanced Contribution to International Standards that are supported by Scientific Evidence</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p><strong>The Program actively engages in international standard development. Its scientific and regulatory research has made important contributions to the international community.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>The Program is active in international collaboration. The Program's contributions to the development of international standards (e.g., on food fortification, chemical contaminants) are widely recognized. Most international work is conducted through Codex and, to a lesser degree, through bilateral and QUAD partnership meetings. The Program is also involved in activities with other international organizations (e.g., FAO, US National Academies, and WHO) and has played a leading role in the creation of the International Food Chemical Safety and Microbial Food Safety Liaison Groups.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p><strong>Immediate Outcome # 4: Improved Knowledge and its Use to Support Policies, Guidelines, Standards, Regulations, Strategies, CFIA Inspections and Assessments</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p><strong>There are some examples of knowledge development by the Program such as research for the enhancement of methods of analysis and testing as well as the development of guidelines and standards. The Program uses this improved knowledge to support regulatory and policy development as well as collaborative work.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>Scientific method development and validation is an activity that contributes to improved knowledge and safety among key Program participants, partners, and stakeholders. The evaluation identified a number of guidelines, standards, frameworks and policies in high priority areas that have been impacted or developed as a result of advancement in scientific and regulatory research (e.g., work on acrylamide-asparaginase interaction, BPA, Listeriosis). The Program has also used this knowledge to inform consultation efforts. Collaboration among key Program participants and Program partners has led to the development of novel technology (e.g., lab on a chip) as well as enhanced surveillance work. Lessons learned and funding received following the 2008 Listeriosis outbreak have contributed to maintaining the currency of microbiological methods, to greater collaboration (e.g., between Health Canada and CFIA) on method development (Health Canada, Public Health Agency of Canada, and CFIA), and to reduce method response turn-around times (e.g., an enhanced method for the confirmation of Listeria provides results in three to five days instead of the former seven to 10). Nonetheless, there are concerns related to the need for increased laboratory capacity to satisfy current and emerging demands, to remain abreast of scientific advances, and to increase internal expertise in a number of fields (e.g., biostatistics, epidemiology, electro-microscopy, bioinformatics, etc.). </p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p><strong>Immediate Outcome # 5: Improved Collaboration with F/P/T Partners and Stakeholders</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p><strong>The Program coordinates priorities and risk management approaches within Canada's FSNQ system and contributes to improved collaboration with partners and stakeholders. There are some issues to be addressed with respect to communications and procedures related to FSAs and HRAs.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>The Program engages in coordination and collaboration through a large number of committees and initiatives that include key Program participants, partners and stakeholders (e.g., FPTSC, FPTGN, the Food Policy and Science Integration Committee, the Food Regulatory Advisory Committee, FIORP). While Health Canada has enhanced the efficiency and reliability of its HRA process to respond to CFIA requests, there are some opportunities to enhance communications and information exchange between Health Canada and CFIA (e.g., e-mail communications, IT tools outages, IT platform differences).</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>In the case of FSAs (which are intended to assess the rationale and design of CFIA's activities, their implementation, and their level of success including compliance with health safety standards), Health Canada/CFIA collaboration has experienced a number of procedural, planning and operational challenges (e.g., difficulties in priority setting, lengthy review and acceptance process, lack of clarity on FSA approach and methodology). In response, in 2010 Health Canada began a review of the FSAP to assess relevance, governance processes and performance and a consideration of FSAP future strategic direction. Health Canada has also begun a project to identify broad themes for food safety improvements and lessons learned. The results of these studies are not yet available. A number of events, including the change in the reporting relationship of CFIA to the Minister of Health and the discontinuation of the FSAP Advisory Committee, are also likely to have an impact on the conduct of FSAs.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p><strong>Intermediate Outcomes</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p><strong>Intermediate Outcome # 1: Healthier Food Choices made by Consumers</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p><strong>While it is not known if consumers have made healthier food choices as a result of Program efforts, evidence points to issues of concern related to the dietary intake of the general population and of First Nations and Inuit communities.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>Available evidence sheds some light on consumer food choices such as high calorie intake from fat and snacks, vegetable and fruit consumption below the recommended daily minimum, a tendency towards fast food and commercially prepared food consumption, and sodium intakes in excess of UL, among others. In the case of First Nations on-reserve and Inuit communities, sodium intakes exceed recommended limits and the consumption of certain food groups is below recommended levels; some food decisions may be affected by food insecurity and its influencing factors, including environmental changes, poverty and high food costs.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>One of the ways in which the Program can aid the consumer in making healthier food choices is through food labels. Data on the success of this tool is inconsistent as some sources point to high consumer uptake, understanding, and use while others report lower use and lack of needed information to make healthy food choices. A lack of standard serving sizes on labels and little understanding of % DV among consumers may be making it difficult for the consumer to make healthier food choices. These are areas in which the Program may be able to influence consumer behaviour.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p><strong>Intermediate Outcome # 2: Reduced Exposure to Microbial, Chemical and Physical Hazards and Nutritional Risks</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p><strong>The number of cases of reported enteric diseases appears to have declined over the past decade, while compliance rates for chemical residue testing have remained overall high. While the change in exposure to nutritional risks could not be ascertained, some Program initiatives appear to be contributing to risk reduction in certain areas.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>The number of cases of reported enteric diseases appears to have declined over the past decade (from 793 to 409 or 48% according to C-EnterNet data, and from 36,544 to 21,132 or 42% according to Notifiable Diseases Online), while compliance rates for chemical residue testing have remained overall high (at or above 95%). Program initiatives, such as awareness campaigns, efforts on trans fat reduction and food fortification, have, in theory, effected changes in the exposure to certain nutritional benefits. </p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p><strong>Intermediate Outcome # 3: Increased Adoption of International Standards by Canada and Other Countries</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p><strong>While it was not possible to identify a change in the level of adoption, there is evidence of adherence by Canada to international standards. Other countries' membership in international standard setting organizations denotes an interest in harmonization.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>Canadian adherence to international standards is evidenced, for example, by alignment with regulatory counterparts on nutritional labelling, microbial and chemical safety, and pesticides. Some delays in adhering to international standards have been linked to lengthy regulatory approval processes (e.g., delays in the approval of asparaginase as a food additive) or to concerns with international approaches that may not reflect the Program's position.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p><strong>Intermediate Outcome # 4: More Integrated Approach to F/P/T Food Safety and Nutrition Priorities and Activities</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p><strong>The Program seeks a more integrated approach to F/P/T food safety and nutrition priorities and activities by collaborating with F/P/T partners and stakeholders.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>The Program actively collaborates, both internally with key Program participants and externally with partners and stakeholders by exchanging information, fostering dialogue, consulting, and coordinating priorities and risk management approaches. While identified concerns related to the effectiveness of communications among key Program participants (e.g., FSAs) and between the Program and its P/T partners (e.g., clarification of roles and functions as well as the role of systems and laboratories in emergency response), are expected to be addressed through recent efforts by F/P/T health and agriculture ministers, more structured stakeholder communications and improved transparency regarding Program activities are needed, for example, to clarify roles and responsibilities between the Program and its P/T partners.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p><strong>Long-Term Outcomes</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p><strong>Long-Term Outcome # 1: Improved Nutritional Status of Canadians</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p><strong>According to available evidence, the nutritional status of Canadians does not appear to have improved over the period of the evaluation.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>Among the general population, there are a number of concerns related to high energy intake (energy intake for 20% of children aged 1 to 8 years exceeds their energy needs), high fat intake, nutrient insufficiency (e.g., many adolescents have inadequate intakes of magnesium, vitamin A, vitamin D, calcium and phosphorous), sodium intakes associated with an increased risk of adverse health effects (across all ages), and rising BMI (e.g., one quarter of Canadians are considered obese). While information on First Nations on-reserve and Inuit communities has been limited, evidence points to low intake of some important vitamins and minerals, high sodium intakes and obesity prevalence.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p><strong>Long-Term Outcome # 2: Reduced Food- and Nutrition-Related Illnesses</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p><strong>Food-related illnesses appear to have decreased over the past decade. Nutrition-related illnesses among the general Canadian population appear to have increased during the same period. The rates of diabetes among First Nations on-reserve are higher than those of the overall Canadian population but seem not to have increased for the last several years (high blood pressure rates have also remained relatively stable). Rates of diabetes and high blood pressure among Inuit populations approach those of the overall Canadian population.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>The number of cases of reported enteric diseases appears to have declined over the past decade, while compliance rates for chemical residue testing have remained overall high. Information directly linking nutrition to illnesses is limited. The rates of high blood pressure, diabetes and heart disease among the general population, three chronic conditions related to nutrition, have increased over the last decade. In the case of First Nations on-reserve, the rates of diabetes are high compared to the overall Canadian population, although these do not appear to have increased for the last several years (similar to high blood pressure rates). Rates of diabetes and high blood pressure among Inuit populations approach those of the overall Canadian population. </p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p><strong>Long-Term Outcome # 3: Safer Food Products in International Trade</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p><strong>The Program contributes to safer food products in international trade. Adoption of international standards by other countries is expected to contribute to international food safety.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>The Program is engaged with international regulatory partners and participates in international fora as part of efforts to standardize, harmonize and increase food safety. Adoption of international standards by other countries is expected to contribute to maintaining and improving food safety.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p><strong>Long-Term Outcome # 4: Canada Viewed as a Responsible Participant and Scientific Expert in an International Context</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p><strong>Through the activities/contribution of the Program, Canada is viewed as a responsible participant and scientific expert in an international context.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>The Program's expertise and contribution to the international community are recognized through its involvement in standard development, as a host of international collaborating centres and laboratories, and as a partner in international capacity development.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p><strong>Long-Term Outcome # 5: A Sustainable and Integrated System for FSNQ in Canada</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p><strong>The Program seeks to maintain an integrated system for FSNQ in Canada through consultation and collaboration with partners and stakeholders. There are challenges to the responsiveness of the regulatory framework, which recent legislative amendments and Program strategic plans are expected to address.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>The Program's approach to consultation and collaboration seeks to engage all partners and stakeholders and is expected to continue to enhance system integration. Government Directives are in place to guarantee a consultative, coordinated and cooperative approach to regulatory development. Nonetheless, the level of responsiveness of the regulatory framework is challenged by a lengthy amendment process, the level of resources to carry out regulatory work, the suitability of surveillance and monitoring measures, emergency response mechanisms, and the authority to act on non-compliance. Recent amendments to the F&amp;DA (e.g., the new Marketing Authorization framework and Incorporation by Reference) are expected to address a number of these concerns.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<h4>5.2.2 Demonstration of Economy and Efficiency</h4>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p><strong>Program performance and financial information was insufficient to properly demonstrate efficiency and economy.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>Financial data available for the evaluation was insufficient to support an analysis of efficiency and economy. As a result, the evaluation could not assess the extent to which Program resources were used as planned, whether Program outputs were produced efficiently, or whether expected outcomes were produced economically. HPFB has recently introduced financial management controls, including an improved time tracking system, to help validate costing.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>The collection of performance data does not appear to be consistent or follow a Program approach to its analysis; there are a variety of measures and formats used and efforts tend to focus on tracking mainly Program outputs.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>There are a number of Program areas where process performance may be affecting efficiency, namely: the pre-market submission assessment process, the HRA process and its infrastructure, stakeholder communication effectiveness, laboratory research capacity, the FSA process, and regulatory modernization. The Program makes limited use of public-private partnerships and outsourcing, which could contribute to efficiency improvement, while it lacks a cost recovery framework to better manage the costs of its pre-market processes.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<h2 id="a60">6.0 Recommendations</h2>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p><strong>Recommendation 1. FD should examine options to enhance the efficiency and transparency of its food pre-market submission activities.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>Overall, pre-market submission assessments are not meeting the regulated time standards (61% increase between FY 2007-2008 and 2012-2013) while some volumes (novel food and food additive) declined between FY 2011-2012 and the third quarter of 2012-2013. During this last period, submissions without regulated time standards saw an increase in some volumes (food packaging and food processing aids) and a decrease in others (incidental additive). FD uses a collaborative approach to submission assessment; however, the evaluation identified several issues contributing to the submission review backlog. Among these, outstanding petitioner information as well as timeliness and communications with respect to the submissions review process are of particular concern to industry stakeholders and contribute to delays.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p><strong>Recommendation 2. FD should examine and improve its HRA tracking processes.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>Trend analysis data points to an increase in CFIA requests for technical advice, which combined with existing FD challenges related to HRA preparation may put pressure on future performance.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p><strong>Recommendation 3. Health Canada should conduct impact assessments of its public outreach initiatives to determine uptake.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>The impact of the Program's products and activities on public awareness and understanding cannot be determined as uptake by audience and time period is not measured. A key challenge to understanding impact is a lack of alignment between delivery mechanism and target population preferences.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p><strong>Recommendation 4. Health Canada should develop a coordinated Program approach to performance measurement with a Health Portfolio perspective.</strong></p>
</div>

<h2 id="app1">Appendix 1 Program Partners and Stakeholders</h2>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>The FSNQP operates with a wide range of partners and stakeholders that complement the activities of the key Program participants in the following areas:</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<ul>
<li>Within Health Canada: 
  <ul>
<li>The Strategic Policy Branch co-ordinates overall health and science policy for the department.</li>
<li>The Healthy Environments and Consumer Safety Branch (HECSB) provides guidance and frameworks to manage chemicals and their effects on the environment and human health.</li>
<li>OCAPI provides information and opportunities for Canadians to become involved in HPFB's decision-making processes regarding priorities, policies and programs.</li>
</ul> </li>
<li>Within the Health Portfolio: 
  <ul>
<li>CIHR fund health research, build research capacity in underdeveloped areas (e.g., population health and health services research) and carry out knowledge translation so that research results may be integrated into the Program's policies, practices, procedures, products and services.</li>
</ul> </li>
<li>Across the federal government: 
  <ul>
<li>AAFC and the Department of Fisheries and Oceans work with FSNQP as it develops policies and regulations that impact these important economic sectors.</li>
<li>StatCan supports the program in acquiring consumption survey data (for intake estimation of nutrients and contaminants) with financial support from the Program...</li>
<li>EC and AANDC contribute with guidance to further inform Program decisions.</li>
<li>AAFC and DFATD work together with the Program and CFIA to develop Canada's positions on food standards set internationally.</li>
</ul> </li>
<li>Nationally: 
  <ul>
<li>P/T governments play a key role in the protection and promotion of the health of Canadians and provide consistent, credible evidence-based policies and messages. Health Canada participates in a variety of F/P/T governance bodies.</li>
<li>The Program works in close collaboration with various stakeholders such as food and nutrition advocacy groups, NGOs, producer associations, consumer action groups, health professionals, patient associations  as well as the food industry.</li>
</ul> </li>
<li>Internationally: 
  <ul>
<li>International organizations such as the WHO, FAO, OIE, the Pan-American Health Organization and, in particular, Codex, play a key role in the Program's efforts to ensure Canada is well represented in international policy development and standards setting fora.</li>
<li>Health Canada maintains close collaborations with USFDA, EFSA, FSANZ as well as several EU member states' food regulatory agencies. Health Canada also participates in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum's Food Safety Cooperation Forum and actively collaborates with the Chinese government and Food Safety organizations.</li>
</ul> </li>
<li>Academia (nationally and internationally): 
  <ul>
<li>Several Program personnel have cross appointments with Canadian universities. Health Canada has established collaboration with other research and academic centres nationally and internationally (e.g., the US National Institute of Medicine). </li>
</ul> </li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<h2 id="app2">Appendix 2 Details on Data Collection and Analysis Methods</h2>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>The evaluation relied on multiple lines of evidence reflected in the data collection methods chosen for the evaluation. These methods included:</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<ul>
<li>Literature review;</li>
<li>File review;</li>
<li>Interviews; and,</li>
<li>Case studies.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>Inclusion/exclusion criteria were used for each of the reviews and case studies to ensure the most appropriate, credible, reliable and relevant information needed to address specific evaluation questions was selected and reviewed. These criteria included:</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<ul>
<li>Time of publication: while mostly data generated between April 1st, 1999 and March 31<sup>st</sup>, 2012 was used to address the core issues, data from other years was also considered for baseline and trend analysis purposes.</li>
<li>Coverage of publication: document content relevant to evaluation issues (e.g., performance measurement and monitoring).</li>
<li>Credibility of source: government publication, peer-reviewed journal articles, grey literature.</li>
<li>Relevancy of information to each indicator and evaluation question.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>For the demonstration of economy and efficiency, an allocative approach was attempted as this is a long-established Program that should have achieved long-term outcomes.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<h3>1.1 Literature Review </h3>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>This method consisted of reviewing a number of pre-selected food safety and nutrition literature pieces, many of which were scientific in nature, to answer questions related to Program functioning, gaps, challenges and emerging issues.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>Evaluators employed Health Canada's Science Library to conduct a general search of documents related to Food Safety and Nutrition Quality (FSNQ). The purpose was to identify and collect relevant articles by scouring any and all sources of information (e.g., databases such as Food Science and Technology Abstracts and AGRICOLA). The search was based on a list of key words and terms used in combination through a set of Boolean operations producing multiple runs. The result from each run was then further refined through a preliminary review process.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>The resulting documents (96) were then analyzed in successive stages: 1) non-relevant documents were first removed; 2) the remaining documents were then analyzed and summarized according to document topic (food safety or nutrition quality), relevance to evaluation question, article citation, objectives, methods, limitations and findings; and, 3) the documents were summarized into key themes within each topic.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<h3>1.2 File Review </h3>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>This method focussed on reviewing documents and databases identified by the Program as relevant to the evaluation. Evidence was compiled according to evaluation indicators and summarized by each evaluation question in order to merge it with information stemming from other methodologies.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>Evaluators collected documents (soft and hard copies) from each key Program participant. These documents (over 2,000 in total) were then allocated by indicator in a “one-to-many” correspondence matrix in order to facilitate initial analysis (i.e., since most documents contained information relevant to multiple indicators, the database allowed for a preliminary assessment of gaps). The bulk of the documents covered the period from 1999 to 2012; documents from 1990 to 1998 were used as baselines while documents from later years, including 2013, were used to reflect recent Program changes or achievements linked to ongoing initiatives. Documents were analyzed in successive steps and summarized by indicator. Each document was then categorized into key themes, by indicator and evaluation question.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>This process was aided by interviews with key stakeholders, conducted between February and May 2009, to obtain a clear understanding of the Program and the context/scope of the evaluation.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>Evaluators also documented information on a number of internal databases and external data files (e.g., survey data) used by the Program. A short list of key databases was then selected to review either the database itself or, in cases where reports existed, reports summarizing the purpose and available data from each application. A number of interviews were then conducted to obtain facts on those databases for which information was not readily available. The relevant information from each database was then incorporated into the analysis.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>A further appraisal and classification of the evidence was accompanied by a secondary review of specific Program sources. Any gaps identified through the review were then addressed through a request for new or extended information from key Program participants. The information obtained through these exercises was then incorporated into the existing evidence.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<h3>1.3 Interviews </h3>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>This method was used to collect and summarize information from a number of key informants, partners and stakeholders addressing Program performance and, in particular, areas identified for further exploration as a result of the literature and file review. The information also served to inform the case study identification and development process.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>Key informants are employees from key Program participants who are knowledgeable about the Program and include staff from FD, BFSA, ONPP, VDD, RAPB, FNIHB, PMRA and Public Health Agency of Canada. Domestic and international partners are organizations that assist in the implementation of the Program (e.g., NGOs), or who have parallel regulatory programs that deal with FSNQ (e.g., F/P/T and international government organizations). Stakeholders receive the benefits or the effects of the Program and include:</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<ul>
<li>Academia;</li>
<li>Food and food product importers and exporters;</li>
<li>Food and farm industry representatives; and,</li>
<li>Consumer associations.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>Due to the large number of individuals involved with the Program, drawing a sample that would produce statistically significant results was financially and time prohibitive. Therefore, evaluators used a stratified purposive sampling<sup><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn140" id="fnb140-ref"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>140</a></sup> approach and engaged key Program participants to generate a list of individuals knowledgeable<sup><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn141" id="fnb141-ref"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>141</a></sup> about the Program across all identified organizations. In this way, although the sample would not be representative of the population or produce statistically significant results, interviews could still elicit valuable information to provide context for the formulation of findings and conclusions, to delve in areas requiring clarification, or to obtain information where documented evidence was not available. By using the interview information in this manner, the potential for bias was reduced to a minimum. A list of 241 knowledgeable individuals, segmented according to the above groups and sub-groups, was used as the knowledgeable population for the interviews.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>As a next step, a master set of interview questions was developed based on the findings elicited from other methodologies. Areas covered by the questions included:</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<ul>
<li>Program relevance and need;</li>
<li>Risk assessment processes;</li>
<li>Consumer perceptions of the Program;</li>
<li>Outcomes from international Program activities;</li>
<li>Development of laboratory methods and results from regulatory research;</li>
<li>Results from domestic collaboration and consultation activities;</li>
<li>Level of integration of Canada's food safety system;</li>
<li>Progress on Program performance measurement activities;</li>
<li>Challenges related to Program resource levels;</li>
<li>Identification of alternative Program delivery structures; and,</li>
<li>Other issues or challenges.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>This master list was then used to develop semi-structured interview guides, which were customized for each group and sub-group. To limit the time impact of the interview process on Program personnel and to encourage participation, interview guides were limited to 20 questions for government interviewees and 12 questions for external interviewees. Where the maximum number of questions was exceeded in the semi-structured interview guides, the questions were divided into high and low priority. Interviewees were given the options of extending the interview, scheduling a second interview, or providing written responses at a later date to questions not covered during the initial interview.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>Individuals were contacted by e-mail and/or telephone to schedule an interview. The semi-structured interview guides were provided to each interviewee (either in English or French) prior to the interview to allow him/her sufficient time to prepare for the dialogue. Interviewer guides contained a series of probes to elicit further information when required; these probes were used at the discretion of the interviewer.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>Individuals were interviewed by applying three interview methods:</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<ul>
<li>One-on-one, in-person interviews;</li>
<li>Group, in-person interviews; and,</li>
<li>Telephone interviews, one-on-one or group (mostly used for interviews outside the National Capital Region).</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>Interviews were conducted in the interviewee's preferred official language. All interviewees were assured that the data would be kept confidential and guaranteed that said data would be non-attributable to encourage candid responses.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>A total of 152 individuals were interviewed across multiple organizations. <strong>Table 19 </strong>summarizes the number of interviews by group and sub-group. Interviews were conducted between October and December 2009.</p>

<p>Estimated times for interviews were 90 minutes for government employees and 60 minutes for external stakeholders. Small interview groups (two to three individuals) were scheduled for two hours. Interviews with several individuals or those with senior Program managers were conducted by two interviewers; all others were conducted by a single interviewer. Evaluators monitored a sample of interviews to ensure acceptable performance and data collection. Interview notes were recorded for each interview, by interview question. Additional documents for review identified during the interview process were noted and a copy requested from the interviewee.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>Interview results were compiled in a matrix by evaluation question and group. Comments were codified in order to allow the identification of top issues and facilitate reporting. Each group was analyzed and non-attributable, summary-level information was reported. Due to the open-ended nature of the questions posed to interviewees, percentages documented in this report reflect multiple responses. Results have been reported as % out of n respondents to a particular question; the top three percentages for a question have normally been reported. In some instances, single mentions have been used to focus on particular areas of interest or to provide background to the answers given by respondents.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<h3>1.4 Case Studies </h3>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>Consultations with key Program participants during the Evaluation Framework development process identified a list (14) of case studies. As a result of the evidence gathered through the previous technical reports, six case studies were selected from this list and completed to inform particular areas of interest. An additional case study on Health Canada's response to the 2008 Listeriosis outbreak was later added to this list to ensure full coverage of Health Canada's Response to the 2008 Listeriosis Outbreak as well as to report on commitments made through a dedicated funding request related to the 2008 Listeriosis outbreak.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>These case studies provided an in-depth understanding of how the various mandated and supporting activities of the Program translated into practice as well as how specific initiatives led to the demonstrable achievement of the Program's expected outcomes. <strong>Table 20 </strong>provides a list of the case studies and their purpose.</p>

<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>For the demonstration of economy and efficiency, an allocative approach was attempted as this is a long-established Program that should have achieved long-term outcomes. To this end, the evaluation sought to obtain information on dedicated funding requests, budgets and derivations, expenditures, and FTEs over the period of the evaluation. The goal was to align dedicated funding requests, with budgets, and expenditures to then track financial changes overt time while attributing them to activities and outcomes. This information, in combination with FTE data, would then allow evaluators to assess resource allocation, investigate efficiencies, and link the results from this analysis to Program data obtained from other sources. The resulting analysis would then also be used to examine how resource changes influenced outcome achievement and the reasons behind the decisions.</p>

<h2 id="app7">Appendix 7 Processes to Consider International Standards</h2>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>Health Canada's international regulatory cooperation approach focuses on:161 </p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<ul>
<li>Developing agreements/arrangement with international regulatory counterparts (e.g., USFDA) and leading organizations (e.g., Codex). 
  <ul>
<li>Canada's strategic objectives for participation in the Joint FAO/WHO Food Standards Program are to enhance Canada's influence on Codex deliberations and outcomes; promote the use of standards as the basis for national policies and regulations; enhance strategic and functional management of Canada's domestic Codex program; and, promote processes to enhance the efficiency of Codex.<sup title="reference">212</sup> </li>
</ul> </li>
<li>Engaging Canadian stakeholders to improve transparency (e.g., as members of Expert Advisory Committees).</li>
<li>Establishing information-sharing activities to enhance quality and efficiency of domestic decision-making (e.g., use of foreign reviews to reduce submission backlogs).</li>
<li>Identifying priorities and accountability measures.</li>
<li>Approaching technical assistance and capacity building initiatives through cost-effective channels (e.g., country visits, training).</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>Similarly, HPFB's objectives in engagement in international regulatory cooperation include:<sup title="reference">162 </sup> </p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<ul>
<li>Developing and strengthening international relations with key regulatory counterparts and other organizations to improve regulatory system performance by adopting best practices, exchanging and integrating scientific knowledge (e.g., developing concurrent and harmonized submissions with other regulators, increasing the use of foreign reviews in decision-making and developing work-sharing mechanisms) and enhancing transparency that would also allow Canada to play an important role in global standard setting.</li>
<li>Collaborating in international standards setting, equivalency and harmonization initiatives by reviewing existing regulations against international standards; harmonizing and adopting new regulations and policies where beneficial and appropriate; implementing adopted standards and regulations; and, strengthening the branch's role as a leader in certain standard-setting bodies (e.g., Codex).</li>
<li>Engaging with countries in the process of developing regulatory systems to enable the exchange of knowledge and practices as well as providing assistance in an effort to improve international harmonization, thus reducing food import risks.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>These approaches and objectives are reflected in FD's international activities as the regulatory lead for FSNQ:<sup title="reference">170</sup> </p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<ul>
<li>Exchanging information and collaborative work with regulatory counterparts from other countries on research, assessment of risks, policy development, standard setting, and other collaborative initiatives in relation to hazards associated with food and the nutritional safety and quality of food. This is done by establishing bilateral or multilateral working relationships through international governmental organizations (e.g., WHO) or regional governmental bodies.</li>
<li>Developing international food safety standards, including nutritional safety and quality, by engaging with international regulatory counterparts (e.g., through QUAD meetings) and leading organizations (e.g., Codex, FAO/WHO Expert Committees, OECD) to promote the development of international food standards that reflect the level of consumer protection achieved by Canadian policies and standards for food safety.</li>
<li>Negotiating and implementing international agreements (e.g., MoUs) on food safety regulatory responsibilities. Committees established under these agreements provide a regular forum for consultation and the opportunity to carry out the functions necessary to implement the agreements and the furtherance of their objectives. For example, Sanitary and Phytosanitary measures Committees (SPS Committees) as mandated by the WTO and NAFTA as well as SPS Committees under the Canada-Costa Rica and Canada-Chile Free Trade Agreements; these Committees discuss issues of concern to members such as the conduct of risk assessments, implementation of equivalence, provision of technical assistance, and procedures to improve transparency. Decisions resulting from the SPS Committees would directly affect how FD establishes food safety requirements for Canada.</li>
<li>Capacity building and technical assistance to developing countries in the areas of food safety; for example, as part of Canada's duties under the WTO Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures and the WTO Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>Under each of its international activities, FD considers a number of elements for engagement and prioritization, for example: 170 </p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<ul>
<li>Relevance in relation to FD's responsibilities and mandate (e.g., policy development and standard setting).</li>
<li>Linkage with governmental, departmental and branch priorities as well as Canada's international commitments and objectives.</li>
<li>Level of regulatory development and “like-mindedness” with international counterpart as well as commonality of issues and potential for synergies.</li>
<li>Scope of the opportunity both internally (e.g., single or multiple key Program participant involvement) and externally (bilateral or multilateral).</li>
<li>Degree to which the activity will contribute to enhancing Canada's food safety system (e.g., by improving compliance with international standards leading to safer imports).</li>
<li>Extent to which agreements may deal with the application of sanitary measures or technical barriers to trade and effects on established WTO Agreements (i.e., Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures or Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade).</li>
<li>Level of impact on Canada's international reputation and influence.</li>
<li>Willingness of the international counterpart to commit resources (human and capital) to the proposed work as well as level of resources involved (e.g., subject-matter experts).</li>
<li>Cost and availability of funding.</li>

According to the WHO and Health Canada guidelines, health risk levels are associated with each of the following BMI categories: normal weight = least health risk; underweight and overweight = increased health risk; obese, class I = high health risk; obese, class II = very high health risk; obese, class III = extremely high health risk. A definition change was implemented in 2004 to conform to the WHO and Health Canada guidelines for body weight classification.

<p>Trans fat is the common name for unsaturated fats with trans-isomer fatty acids. Industrially made trans fat comes from adding hydrogen to vegetable oil through a process called hydrogenation. Trans fats are more solid than oil, making them less likely to spoil. Using trans fats in the manufacturing of foods helps foods stay fresh longer, have a longer shelf life and have a less greasy feel.</p>
