<h2 id="hd1">Executive Summary</h2>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>An integral part of creating an ethical workplace  environment involves developing clear and consistent standards for addressing  employee misconduct in the event that inappropriate behaviour occurs.</p>
<p>Paragraph 51(1)(f) of the Canada Revenue Agency Act authorizes the Canada  Revenue Agency (CRA) to establish standards of discipline for its employees and  prescribe penalties including suspension and termination of employment that may  be applied to breaches of discipline or misconduct<sup id="fn1-0-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn1"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The Internal Audit Division of the  Audit, Evaluation, and Risk Branch (AERB) completed an internal audit of the  Management of Discipline in May 2014 (see <a href="#hd22">Appendix E</a>). Opportunities for  improvement were identified in the application, administration, and reporting  of discipline. Action plans were developed to address the recommendations. The  current internal audit was conducted as a follow up to the 2014 Management of  Discipline audit.</p>
<h3>Objective</h3>
<p>The objective of this follow-up audit was to assess the extent  to which selected internal controls in place are efficient, effective, and  functioning as intended for the consistent and timely administration of  discipline at the CRA.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>As part of the planning phase of the follow-up audit, the  completeness of the action plans from 2014 were assessed. That assessment  contributed to a risk-based approach determining which internal controls to  focus on during the audit. Of the 12 recommendations issued as part of the 2014  Management of Discipline Audit, 9 were addressed and 3 were partially addressed.</p>
<p>Subsequent to the 2014 Management of Discipline internal  audit, internal controls have been strengthened in the areas of documentation  of discipline files, timeliness of disciplinary decisions, and adequacy of the  monitoring framework. Furthermore, internal controls are in place to support  the consistent administration of discipline at the CRA. However,  opportunities exist to enhance internal controls by:</p>
<ul>
<li>communicating information to Labour Relations  Advisors and other front line employees in the Human Resources Branch (HRB); </li>
<li>implementing consistent file monitoring  practices to assess the extent of compliance to policy instruments and  procedures;</li>
<li>reviewing the AC  consultation process to clarify documentation requirements; and</li>
<li>ensuring increased managers’ awareness of  requirements regarding employee notification when the discipline process cannot  be concluded within 30 working days from the time when the employee received  the completed investigation report or was made aware of the facts for which  discipline is being considered.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Action Plan</h3>
<p>The HRB agreed with the recommendations in this report and has  developed related action plans. The Workplace Relations and Compensation  Division will develop and implement a national quality review process of the  discipline files, enhance communication practices with labour relation  employees, develop a standardized process for AC consultations, increase  management awareness of the 30-working day requirement and monitor  documentation requirements. The AERB has reviewed management’s action plans and  concluded that they are adequate and reasonable to address the recommendations.</p>
<h2 id="hd2">Introduction</h2>
<p>The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) has  established and maintained broad systems of internal control to help mitigate  the risks related to the achievement of program goals. Internal control  activities are designed to provide reasonable assurance that particular  objectives are achieved as intended and may be categorized by the type or  nature of activity. It is important to understand that no one control measure  alone can provide adequate assurance; rather it is their combination that  provides strength in the internal controls.</p>
<p>Misconduct is defined<sup id="fn2-0-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn2"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>2</a></sup> as  a willful action or omission by an employee that contravenes an act, a  regulation, a rule, the Code of Integrity and Professional Conduct, or a policy  instrument, and which may result in disciplinary action. The relative  seriousness of the misconduct depends on several factors. This includes the  extent to which the misconduct renders the employee unable to perform his or her  duties in an impartial or satisfactory manner, injures the general reputation  of CRA and its employees, and breaches the trust that is essential to the  employer-employee relationship.</p>
<p>An integral part of creating an ethical  workplace environment involves developing clear and consistent standards for  discipline. In December 2015, the CRA’s Directive on discipline<sup id="fn3-0-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn3"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>3</a></sup>,in conjunction with the Policy on Workplace  Management, replaced the 2011 Discipline Policy. The Directive on discipline is  supplemented by the Procedures for addressing employee misconduct<sup id="fn4-0-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn4"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>4</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Assistant Commissioners are responsible for  ensuring that these policy instruments are implemented, monitored, and  accessible to managers and employees.</p>
<p>The objectives of the Directive on discipline are  three-fold:</p>
<ul>
<li>to       increase awareness and understanding of the CRA's management of misconduct       and promote its established standards of discipline; </li>
<li>to ensure a fair, consistent, timely, and       corrective approach to discipline; and </li>
<li>to deter employees from engaging in acts of       misconduct.<sup id="fn3-0-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn3"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>3</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<p>The Directive contains a “Table of  Disciplinary Measures” where acts of misconduct are assigned to a group  associated with a suggested range of disciplinary measures (see Figure 1). The  groups relate to the relative seriousness of the misconduct and the ranges help  achieve consistency in the application of discipline. To determine the  appropriate disciplinary measure within the range, it is mandatory to consider mitigating  and aggravating factors and to consult with a Labour Relations Advisor (LRA).  Mitigating factors are circumstances that may warrant reducing the disciplinary  measure imposed, while aggravating factors may warrant the opposite effect<sup id="fn5-0-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn5"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>5</a></sup>.</p>
<p><img class="img-responsive" src="/content/dam/cra-arc/migration/cra-arc/images/chrt1-eng.jpg"/></p>
<details><summary>Figure  1: Table of Disciplinary  Measures (April 2016)</summary>
<p>Misconducts  are associated to a group with a range of disciplinary measures that reflects  the relative seriousness with which the CRA views the associated misconduct.</p>
<p>Group 1  misconducts: disciplinary measures range from oral reprimand to 5-day  suspension</p>
<p>Group 2 misconducts:  disciplinary measures range from written reprimand to 10-day suspension</p>
<p>Group 3 misconducts:  disciplinary measures range from 1-day to 20-day suspension</p>
<p>Group 4 misconducts:  disciplinary measures range from 5-day to 30-day suspension</p>
<p>Group 5 misconducts:  disciplinary measures range from 20-day suspension to termination</p>
<p>Disciplinary  measures can fall outside the suggested range</p>
</details>
<p>To achieve a consistent management of the discipline process, the CRA  introduced and defined formal consultation requirements in 2013 as part of the  Procedures for Addressing Employee Misconduct. Files warranting a disciplinary  measure that falls outside the range of suggested disciplinary measures require  consultation with the Labour Relations Division (LRD) of the Workplace Relations  and Compensation Directorate (WRCD) and, in some cases, the relevant Assistant  Commissioner (AC).</p>
<p>The WRCD is the functional authority for  labour relations and holds primary responsibility for the Directive on  discipline and the related corporate policy instruments. It coordinates  monitoring and reporting activities on incidents of misconduct related to  disciplinary measures and coordinates communication and training material  related to the Directive.</p>
<p>Since April 2016, the central point of  contact for labour relations policies and programs has been the LRD. The  division’s activities include providing advice, direction, and recommendations  to senior management on the development and maintenance of the national labour  relations policies and programs that aim to address employee misconduct through  the application of disciplinary measures in cases where the employee’s  behaviour was culpable.</p>
<p>Six regional Workplace Relations Centres of  Expertise (WRCoEs) provide consulting services to managers in labour relations  matters. As of April 1, 2016, the WRCoEs (Headquarters, Atlantic, Ontario,  Pacific, Prairie, and Quebec) report to the Deputy Assistant Commissioner of the  Human Resources Branch (HRB) through their respective regional Director of Human  Resources.</p>
<h2 id="hd3">Focus  of the Audit</h2>
<p>The Internal  Audit Division (IAD) of the Audit, Evaluation, and Risk Branch completed an  internal audit of the Management of Discipline in May 2014. Opportunities for  improvement were identified in the consistency, application, and reporting of  discipline. Action plans were developed to address the recommendations and the IAD  committed to  initiating a follow-up audit in 2015-2016.</p>
<p>As part of the  current audit, the status of the action plans from the 2014 audit was assessed  and the audit scope for this audit was adjusted accordingly. The objective of this  audit was to assess the extent to which selected internal controls in place are  efficient, effective, and functioning as intended for the consistent and timely  administration of discipline at the CRA.</p>
<p>Examination  activities and interviews were conducted at five out of six WRCoE regional offices.  The audit team also reviewed judgement samples of discipline files to test  consistency in the disciplinary process and the completeness of discipline  files. The file samples covered a wide range of misconducts by employees at  various levels with disciplinary decisions made between April 1, 2014 and  June 30, 2016. A focus was placed on the highest risk types of misconduct such  as unauthorized access and disclosure. <a href="#hd20">Appendix C</a> provides details on the file  selection methodology.</p>
<p>The examination phase took  place from November 2016 to March 2017.</p>
<p>The audit was conducted in  accordance with the International Standards for the Professional Practice of  Internal Auditing.</p>
<h2 id="hd4">Findings, Recommendations, and Action Plans</h2>
<p>As with other internal audits, the recommendations presented  in this report only address issues of significance or mandatory requirements.  Of the 12 recommendations issued as part of the 2014 Management of Discipline  Audit, 9 were addressed and 3 were partially addressed. See <a href="#hd22">Appendix E</a> for a  disposition of recommendations from the 2014 audit.</p>
<h2 id="hd5">1.0 Program Management</h2>
<h3 id="hd6">1.1 Communication of policies and procedures</h3>
<p>The CRA updates its discipline policy instruments and supporting tools  on a regular basis. In December 2015, a new Workplace Management policy suite  with 11 policy instruments was launched as part of the Human Resources Policy  Renewal and Simplification Project. This included a new Directive on Discipline  and modifications to the Procedures for Addressing Employee Misconduct to  promote a corrective approach to inappropriate behaviour or misconduct. A  comprehensive communication strategy was utilized to communicate these changes  to employees.</p>
<p>Ongoing communication practices include monthly conference  calls at the Assistant Director level and communication of information to LRAs  using the Labour Relations Voice Newsletter. However, interviews with LRAs indicated  that when it comes to ad hoc updates, LRAs were not always kept informed of the  latest updates to tools and procedures or the reasons for the changes. Modifications  to procedures, templates, and tools are communicated by the WRCD to management  of the WRCoEs but the information is not always transferred to the front line  employees. Although the WRCD maintains up-to-date documents and templates in  SharePoint, LRAs find it more convenient to access these documents on their  local shared drive.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation:  The WRCD should ensure that updated tools and  procedures are consistently communicated to and used by WRCoE employees.</strong></p>
<p>Action Plan</p>
<p>The WRCD will ensure updates to tools and procedures,  including the reasons for the changes, are communicated through continued  quarterly communications with the Labour Relations (LR) community, such as  conference calls, the “LR Voice” newsletters, and the HRToolZone.</p>
<p>Completion date: Completed</p>
<p>The WRCD will centralize all LR tools in the HRToolZone (CRA  Wiki) and ensure the page for Misconduct and Discipline is well structured and  organized (ex. folders for current and archive content).</p>
<p>Completion date: June  2017</p>
<p>The WRCD will send out a communication to Labour Relations Advisors  to:</p>
<ul>
<li>“follow” KnowHow pages specific to LR topics  (ex. Misconduct and Discipline) and HRToolZone pages; and</li>
<li>“subscribe” to the <em>What’s new in HR</em> newsletter. </li>
</ul>
<p>Completion date: June  2017</p>
<p>The WRCD will inform each regional WRCoE to update their  respective distribution lists in HRToolZone on a quarterly basis.</p>
<p>Completion date: June 2017</p>
<h3 id="hd7">1.2 Support and training tools</h3>
<p>The 2014 Management of Discipline audit found that InfoZone was  the first source of reference for CRA managers and employees and recommended  that complete and comprehensive reference material and resources on all aspects  of discipline be included in the Employee Corner on the Infozone. Recommendation  #10 in <a href="#hd22">Appendix E</a> describes the corresponding recommendation, which was  addressed.</p>
<p>Employee Corner topics have since been moved to the MyHR  webpage. The MyHR page contains a link to the Discipline Toolbox. The  Discipline Toolbox contains links to the Directive on discipline, the  Procedures for addressing employee misconduct and the Guide for investigating  misconduct.</p>
<p>Reference materials are supplemented with training tools which  are available to employees and managers. The online course “Discipline–What you  should know” presents information on discipline and is available to all  employees. For managers, the online course “Discipline–Delegation for Managers”  is available. The Canada School of Public Service (CSPS) has also recently  introduced a three-day labour relations course for managers to replace the  CRA-delivered course. The IAD concluded that the availability of information  and training tools on the discipline process was adequate.</p>
<p>InfoZone’s  information and training on the discipline process for managers are being  reviewed to be more process-based rather than rules-based, as identified  through a HRB-led consultation with managers. Those  initiatives are works in progress.</p>
<h3 id="hd8">1.3 Test on the consistent application of the Table  of Disciplinary Measures</h3>
<p>The Procedures for addressing employee misconduct state that  “at each step of the disciplinary process, the manager must consult with a Labour  Relations Advisor.”<sup id="fn6-0-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn6"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>6</a></sup> When addressing misconduct, the delegated manager determines an appropriate  disciplinary measure in consultation with the LRA. The disciplinary measure  must take into account relevant jurisprudence as well as aggravating and mitigating  factors. The Table of Disciplinary Measures provides direction for determining  the quantum of discipline and helps ensure fairness and consistency with the  disciplinary process.</p>
<p>In cases where the delegated manager decides to render a  decision outside the range of what is suggested by the Table of Disciplinary  Measures, the LRD must be consulted. Those additional consultation requirements  are also required for highest risk discipline cases such as Group 4 and 5  misconducts, indefinite administrative suspensions pending the result of the  investigation, and terminations. Consultation with the LRD helps ensure  consistency of disciplinary decisions, and alignment with applicable  jurisprudence. Consultation with an Assistant Commissioner or the Assistant Commissioner  of the HRB is also required under some circumstances (see <a href="#hd21">Appendix D</a> for  details on consultation requirements). Despite the consultation requirements,  the delegated manager remains the decision making authority in rendering  discipline.</p>
<p>Based on the IAD’s review of a sample of disciplinary  decisions from all regions made between April 2014 and June 2016, decisions conformed<sup id="fn7-0-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn7"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>7</a></sup> to the quantum of  discipline suggested by the Table of Disciplinary Measures once mitigating and  aggravating factors as well as applicable jurisprudence were taken into  account. </p>
<h3 id="hd9">1.4 Test of the completeness of discipline files</h3>
<p>The Directive on Discipline and the Procedures for addressing  misconduct policy instruments provide guidance on documentation standards. The  Labour Relations Case File Checklist and the Manager’s Case File Checklist outline  the documentation needed to ensure completeness of Labour Relations files.</p>
<p>During the 2014 Management of Discipline audit, a review of  discipline files was undertaken to assess whether the files were complete and  contained the necessary information to support actions taken. A judgement  sample was selected, which included files from all regions and that corresponded  to 25% of the file population for the period of April 1, 2009 to March 31,  2013. Sixteen criteria were selected to measure completeness in each file. The  results of the file review are displayed in Figure 2 for the years 2009-2010 to  2012-2013. Recommendation #5 in <a href="#hd22">Appendix E</a> was issued for the HRB to ensure  that Labour Relations files were complete and adequate.</p>
<p>WRCD addressed the recommendation through its action plan to  introduce the Labour Relations Case File Checklist in April 2014. This checklist  intended to supplement the Manager’s Case File Checklist, which had been in use  since June 2011.</p>
<p>The IAD repeated the completeness test to determine if  controls over completeness had improved since the last audit. The IAD took a  judgement sample corresponding to 26% of the file population covering five of  the six regions. The IAD used nine of the criteria that had been used in the  2014 audit and added twelve more<sup id="fn8-0-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn8"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>8</a></sup>. The compliance rate calculated  from the twenty-one criteria improved from 85% to 91% for the review period. This  is a significant improvement in the overall compliance rate from the previous  audit which had ranged from 55% to 65% (see Figure 2).</p>
<p><img class="img-responsive" src="/content/dam/cra-arc/migration/cra-arc/images/chrt2-eng.jpg"/></p>
<details><summary>Figure 2: Compliance  Rates of Discipline Files</summary>
<p>Completeness  Rate of Discipline Files (%)</p>
<p>2014 Audit</p>
<p>2009-2010: 55%</p>
<p>2010-2011: 56%</p>
<p>2011-2012: 61%</p>
<p>2012-2013: 65%</p>
<p>2017 Audit</p>
<p>2014-2015: 85%</p>
<p>2015-2016: 87%</p>
<p>2016-2017: 91% (Q1)</p>
</details>
<p>Although improvements are still possible, based on the file  review and taking into account the improving trend, the IAD determined that  discipline files generally contained the relevant information and documentation  to support actions taken.</p>
<h3 id="hd10">1.5 Documentation of consultation requirements</h3>
<p>During the 2014 Management of Discipline audit, it was  reported that consultation with LRAs was not always performed or documented on  a consistent basis and that adherence to consultation requirements was not  monitored as per the Discipline Policy. Recommendations #3 and #4 in <a href="#hd22">Appendix E</a>  were partially met through improvements to discipline tools.</p>
<p>Using the sample for the test of the completeness of files, the  IAD reviewed discipline files to determine whether the consultation requirement  had been adhered to during the discipline process. Evidence of consultation was  found in 91% of files which was a significant improvement from the findings of  the 2014 audit. However, the documentation of the consultation with ACs was found to be inconsistent.</p>
<p>The delegated manager must consult with the AC when the following  scenarios occur:</p>
<ul>
<li>Discipline outside the range (excluding       progressive discipline);</li>
<li>Cases of unauthorized access or disclosure of       taxpayer information;</li>
<li>Discipline rendered for cases of abuse of authority       resulting in reprisals towards        taxpayers or threats of reprisals towards taxpayers; and</li>
<li>Resignations (subsequent to alleged misconduct       or in lieu of discipline)<sup id="fn9-0-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn9"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>9</a></sup>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The policy instruments and the related tools state who should  be consulted and when, but they do not clearly state the documentation required  for AC consultation.</p>
<p>Throughout the file review such documentation was inconsistent,  in terms of the level of information shared with the AC as well as the format  of AC’s concurrence with the proposed corrective measure. This documentation ranged  from oral briefings to e-mail communications, with or without the briefing  paper.</p>
<p>Clear documentation requirements for AC consultations would  help ensure that the AC has all the information required on the employee’s  misconduct to make an informed decision.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation: The WRCD  should review the AC consultation process and clarify documentation  requirements.</strong></p>
<p>Action Plan</p>
<p>The WRCD will develop a standardized briefing note template for AC  consultation. </p>
<p>The WRCD will implement the use of the standardized briefing  note as part of consultation and documentation processes.</p>
<p>Completion date: March 2018</p>
<p>The WRCD will monitor the use of the standardized briefing  note through the Quality Review process.</p>
<p>Completion date: September 2018</p>
<h3 id="hd11">1.6 Quality review (QR) processes</h3>
<p>The 2014 audit had found that an Agency-wide standard was not  in place to ensure consistency in file documentation and records management.  Therefore, recommendation #5 in <a href="#hd22">Appendix E</a> was made to establish clear national  direction for documentation of files to ensure they are complete and adequate. This  recommendation was partially addressed through the implementation of a  checklist to strengthen the file management process. However, there are still  no Agency-wide monitoring practices to ensure consistency in file management.</p>
<p>Discipline files are maintained and reviewed in the regional  WRCoEs. During the examination phase of this audit, the IAD observed some form  of file review in each of the regions visited. However, the nature and extent  of QR, the accountability for review, and how QR results were documented varied  from one region to another due to the absence of national guidelines. Local and  regional QR results were often used to identify training opportunities for  Labour Relations Advisors but QR information was not being compiled or shared  with the WRCD for monitoring purposes. A standard, consistent, and continuous  QR process that includes reporting activities is required to provide assurance  that the discipline process is in compliance with the Agency’s Discipline policy  instruments.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation: The WRCD  should implement a national QR process of the discipline files to ensure the  completeness of files and consistency of compliance with policy instruments,  procedures, or tools across the regions.</strong></p>
<p>Action Plan </p>
<p>The WRCD will develop and implement a national QR process of  the discipline files, which will ensure completeness of files and compliance  with policy instruments, procedures, or tools.</p>
<p>Completion date: September 2018</p>
<h3 id="hd12">1.7 Monitoring framework</h3>
<p>During the 2014 audit, recommendations were made to ensure  data was captured consistently, analyzed, and reported back to management for  decision-making. The HRB has addressed recommendations #7 and #8 in Appendix E by  developing a monitoring framework<sup id="fn10-0-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn10"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>10</a></sup> that is used to collect  data on disciplinary measures, assess performance of the policy instruments,  and identify gaps related to its application.</p>
<p>Monitoring of discipline across the Agency and the reporting  of results to senior management is the responsibility of the LRD. Most of the  monitoring information is collected through the Corrective Measures Reporting Template  (CMRT) which was first introduced in 2012. A CMRT must be completed for every  disciplinary measure and is sent to the WRCD at various stages in the  discipline process. </p>
<p>The information collected is used for the completion of a  number of reports (quarterly, annual, and semi-annual) for senior management. The  IAD reviewed these reports and observed that WRCD is monitoring high risk areas  such as the number of cases that did not meet the 30-working day requirement  for rendering decisions, a list of reasons for not meeting the 30-working day  timeline, information about cases going outside the range on the Table of  Disciplinary Measures, and the number of grievance cases. The IAD found that  through this combined reporting effort, discipline is being adequately  monitored.</p>
<h3 id="hd13">1.8 Timeliness of disciplinary decisions and  notification requirements</h3>
<p>The Procedures for Addressing Employee Misconduct states that  following the disciplinary hearing, “the discipline process should be concluded within 30 working days from when  the employee received the completed investigation report, or was made aware of  the facts for which discipline is being considered.” The HRB Dashboard  Target for this standard is that decisions be rendered within 30 working days  75% of the time. </p>
<p>Results from the 2014 Management of Discipline audit indicated  that the 30-working day requirement to render discipline was not being met and  the rationale for not meeting the requirement was not always documented. The  corresponding recommendation, recommendation #6 in <a href="#hd22">Appendix E</a>, was partially met. </p>
<p>The IAD reviewed all disciplinary decisions for the period under  review and found that the HRB Dashboard target was being met. In addition, the  rationale for not meeting this requirement was also being documented for all  files through the Corrective Measures Reporting Template and reported to the  WRCD for monitoring purposes. </p>
<p>The Procedures for Addressing Employee Misconduct also specify  that if the discipline process cannot be conducted within 30 working days from  the time when the employee received the completed investigation report, or was  made aware of the facts for which discipline is being considered, then the  manager must inform the employee and the LRA, in writing, of the reason for the  delay. A file review determined that this was documented in only 65% of files.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation: The WRCD  should increase managers’ awareness of the requirement to notify employees and  the LRA if the disciplinary decision cannot be rendered within 30 working days  and to document this notification. </strong></p>
<p>Action Plan</p>
<p>The WRCD will develop a job aid on KnowHow, to increase managers’  awareness of the 30-working day notification and its associated documentation  requirements.</p>
<p>Completion date: June  2018</p>
<p>The WRCD is to reinforce regional LRAs role in reminding managers  of the 30-working day requirement and to document the manager’s notification in  their discipline files.</p>
<p>Completion date: October  2017</p>
<p>The WRCD will monitor the 30-working day notification and  documentation requirements through the Quality Review process.</p>
<p>Completion date: September 2018</p>
<h3 id="hd14">1.9 Management awareness of the disciplinary process</h3>
<p>A recommendation from the 2014 audit was for the HRB to ensure awareness  and understanding of the management of discipline for managers (recommendation  #9 in <a href="#hd22">Appendix E</a>).  The recommendation  was addressed.</p>
<p>From February 2016 to June 2016, the HRB consulted with  managers in the regions about human resources tools. Those consultations were  carried out as part of the HR Modernization Tool Renewal and Simplification  Project. Information on managers’ awareness of discipline tools and policy  instruments was collected as part of the process. This information on  management awareness was supplemented with the IAD interviews with labour  relations staff. The following list summarizes the highlights of the consultations  and the IAD work:</p>
<ul>
<li>Managers were aware that Labour Relations is  their first point of contact to handle discipline cases.</li>
<li>Managers were aware of the existence of the  Table of Disciplinary Measures.</li>
<li>Managers were made aware of the documentation requirements  through communications with the LRAs. </li>
<li>Managers were reminded of their obligation to  communicate to employees facing discipline their rights and the availability of  Employee Assistance Programs through communications with their LRAs.</li>
<li>Managers sought guidance on which tool to use  when they were ready to use them (in real time) rather than becoming familiar  with the policies and tools in place.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a result of the consultation process, the  HRB is in the process of developing learning sessions and just-in-time tools to  complement the CSPS “Labour Relations Principles and Practices” course and the  CRA Discipline e‑learning products (TD1527 and TD1509). The IAD assessed that  management awareness of the discipline process was adequate.</p>
<h2 id="hd15">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The CRA is committed to sustaining a respectful workplace and a  culture of integrity. CRA employees are held to a high standard of conduct and  the CRA has implemented controls to help maintain this expected standard.</p>
<p>The completeness of the action plans from the  2014 Management of Discipline Audit were assessed: Of the 12 recommendations  issued as part of the 2014 audit, 9 were addressed and 3 were partially  addressed. Subsequent to the 2014 Management of Discipline audit, internal  controls have been strengthened in the areas of documentation of discipline  files, timeliness of disciplinary decisions and adequacy of the monitoring  framework. However, opportunities exist to enhance internal controls by:</p>
<ul>
<li>communicating information to Labour Relations  Advisors and other front line employees in the HRB; </li>
<li>implementing consistent file monitoring  practices to assess the extent of compliance to policy instruments and  procedures;</li>
<li>reviewing the AC consultation process to clarify documentation requirements; and</li>
<li>ensuring increased managers’ awareness of  requirements regarding employee notification when the discipline process cannot  be concluded within 30 working days from the time when the employee received  the completed investigation report or was made aware of the facts for which  discipline is being considered.</li>
</ul>
<p>The internal controls in place support the  consistent and timely administration of discipline at the CRA. By addressing  the findings from the audit, the Agency will strengthen its commitment to  upholding the integrity of Canada's tax system. </p>
<h2 id="hd16">Acknowledgement</h2>
<p>In  closing, the IAD would like to acknowledge, recognize, and thank the WRCD and  the WRCoEs of the regions visited for their time and for the information and  access to the files provided during the course of this engagement.</p>

<li>renders the employee unable to    perform their duties in an impartial or satisfactory manner; </li>
<li>is injurious to the general    reputation of the CRA and its employees; and </li>
<li>breaches the trust that is    essential to the employer-employee relationship.</li>

<h2 id="hd20">Appendix  C: Methodology</h2>
<p>The Internal Audit (follow-up)—Management of Discipline was  conducted as a follow up to the 2014 Management of Discipline audit. Opportunities  for improvement were identified in the application, administration, and  reporting of discipline. Action plans were developed to address the  recommendations from the 2014 audit.</p>
<p>As part of the planning phase of the follow-up audit, the  completeness of the action plans from 2014 were assessed. That assessment  contributed to a risk-based approach to determine on which internal controls to  focus during the audit.</p>
<p>Among the tests conducted during the examination phase, there were  two tests that required IAD to review a sample of disciplinary decisions from a  population of 642 decisions made between April 1, 2014 and June 30, 2016. </p>
<p><strong>Test of the consistent  application of the Table of Disciplinary Measures </strong></p>
<p>A stratified sample of 26 files was taken from each region. A  greater sampling weight was put on misconducts related to failure to protect  information and CRA’s reputation. An additional 32 files were added to the  sample. Those files consisted of the population of disciplinary decisions that  were made outside the range of the Table of Disciplinary Measures. This  resulted in a judgement sample of 198 disciplinary decisions.</p>
<p><strong>Test of the completeness  of discipline files </strong></p>
<p>Site visits were required to test the completeness of files.  The audit team visited five out of six regions. The sample used was identical  as for the consistency test but excluded the files from the region that was not  visited. A total of 169 files were reviewed to test the completeness of  discipline files.</p>

<p>Depending on the nature of the case, steps may need to be  repeated, and some consultations may take place simultaneously to ensure the  decisions are rendered in the most efficient manner. Therefore, labour  relations advisors may modify the flow of the consultations, on a case-by-case  basis, to effectively manage their cases.</p>
