<h2 id="s2">Executive Summary</h2>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>This evaluation covered the First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care (<abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr>) program for the period from April 1, 2008 to March 31, 2012. The evaluation was undertaken in fulfillment of the requirements of the <em>Financial Administration Act</em> and the Treasury Board of Canada’s <em>Policy on Evaluation (2009)</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<h3>Evaluation Purpose, Scope and Design</h3>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>The purpose of the evaluation was to assess the relevance and performance of the <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> Program. The methodology used in the evaluation included input from 415 individuals from all provinces and territories through interviews, an online stakeholder survey and case studies of key issues. In addition, a review of documents, data, and literature was conducted. This was the second evaluation of the program, having been previously evaluated in 2009.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<h3>Program Description</h3>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>The <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> Program provides basic home and community care services that are comprehensive, culturally sensitive, accessible and responsive to the unique health and social needs of First Nations and Inuit. The program enables First Nations and Inuit people of all ages with disabilities, chronic or acute illnesses and the elderly to receive the care they need in their homes and communities. The program is primarily provided through contribution agreements with First Nation and Inuit communities and territorial governments and strives to be comparable to home and community care services offered to other Canadian residents in similar geographical areas. The <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> Program average expenditures for the four-year period under evaluation were approximately $110 million annually. The Program is delivered in 657 First Nations and Inuit communities primarily by home care registered nurses, licensed practical nurses and trained and certified personal care workers. Essential service elements include client assessments, case management, nursing, personal and supportive care, and in-home respite.</p>

<h3>Evaluation Conclusions and Recommendations</h3>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<h4>Conclusions - Relevance</h4>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<h5>Continued Need for the Program</h5>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>The <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> Program continued to be relevant to First Nations and Inuit home and community care needs. The program design and funding were responsive to essential home care needs. The needs related to First Nation and Inuit home and community care are expected to increase and become increasingly more complex and, in response, a 10-Year Strategic Business Plan for the <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> Program is being developed.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<h5>Alignment with Government Priorities</h5>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>The <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> Program is a mandatory program within the Primary Health Care Authority First Nations and Inuit Health Program and aligned with federal government and Health Canada priorities as identified in Budget 2008, Budget 2009 and various federal policies and initiatives.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<h5>Alignment with Federal Roles and Responsibilities</h5>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>The <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> Program aligned with the federal roles of the First Nations and Inuit Health Branch of Health Canada which has the responsibility to provide or fund the provision of First Nations and Inuit health programs consistent with the Indian Health Policy and subsequent Departmental mission or mandate statements. The <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> Program clearly aligned with Health Canada’s strategic outcomes.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<h4>Conclusions - Performance</h4>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<h5>Achievement of Expected Outcomes (Effectiveness)</h5>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>The <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> Program was delivered as intended and is progressing towards its intended outcomes, including the long term outcome to be responsive to the needs of First Nations individuals and communities through the provision of home and community care services.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>The program has been stable in terms of the services provided over the evaluation period and continues to provide access to essential home and community care services. While there have been initiatives to increase the capacity of the home and community care workforce, the evaluation found that lower capacity regional offices are challenged to deliver the HCC program in comparison with higher capacity regional offices. While there have been improvements in the collaboration of <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> Program staff with other health care providers, linkages with social programs in communities are somewhat less effective. There have been regional and community efforts to improve the coordination with other programs in order to deliver seamless responses to home and community care needs (e.g., the integration of the program and the Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada Assisted Living Program - In-Home Care Component).</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>Initiatives have begun to increase the use of policies, standards, guidelines, best practices, and evidence-based information which are expected to have a positive future impact on program delivery at the community and regional levels. Although expected, it is not yet evident the degree to which national initiatives will increase the use of quality improvement processes.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<h5>Demonstration of Economy and Efficiency</h5>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>The <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> Program is considered to be efficiently managed and delivered. To maximize funds, the economy and efficiency of the program could be improved through increasing the capacity of lower capacity regional offices, clustering program delivery across communities, integrating programs, streamlining reporting requirements across programs, improving performance measurement and making greater use of technology.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<h4>Recommendations</h4>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<h5>Recommendation 1</h5>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>Health Canada should develop options for increasing the capacity of regional offices that have lower capacity to support the efficient delivery of the <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> Program in communities.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<h5>Recommendation 2</h5>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>Health Canada should continue pursuing its negotiation with Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada (<abbr>AANDC</abbr>)to achieve formal integration of the <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> Program with the <abbr title="Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada">AANDC</abbr> Assisted Living Program - In-Home Component to improve efficiencies in the delivery of home care services.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<h5>Recommendation 3</h5>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>Health Canada should strengthen linkages and partnerships between the program and other external social programs to increase collaboration.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<h5>Recommendation 4</h5>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>Health Canada should continue its current initiatives to improve quality program delivery through the use of evidence-based information, program policies and standards, and quality improvement processes in a manner that is relevant and sustainable within current resource levels of regions and communities.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<h5>Recommendation 5</h5>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>Health Canada should revise the logic model for the <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> Program to ensure expected outcomes are reflective of the nature of this health program moving forward and ensure adequate program data are collected to facilitate decision-making and future evaluation.</p>

<h3 id="e2.2">2.2 Program Profile</h3>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>The objective of the <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> Program is to provide First Nations and Inuit with basic home and community care services such as: client assessments, case management, nursing, personal and supportive care, and in-home respite.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>The <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> Program is delivered primarily by home care Registered Nurses (<abbr>RNs</abbr>), Licensed Practical Nurses (<abbr>LPNs</abbr>) and trained and certified personal care workers. Service delivery is based on assessed need and follows a case management process. Essential service elements that all communities are required to deliver include: client assessment; home care nursing; case management; home support (personal care and home management); in-home respite; linkages and referrals as needed to other health and social services; provision of and access to specialized medical equipment and supplies for care; and a system of client record keeping and data collection.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>Additional supportive services may also be provided, depending on the needs of the communities and funding availability. Supportive services may include, but are not limited to: rehabilitation and other therapies; in-home palliative care; adult day care; meal programs; in-home mental health care; and specialized health promotion activities.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>The federal government established the <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> Program in the 1999 Budget to provide basic home and community care services for First Nations and Inuit.<sup><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn5" id="fnb5-ref"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>5</a></sup>The program was a response to the urgent needs of First Nations and Inuit for home care services identified in recent studies. These needs included the disproportionately high rates of disabilities and chronic or acute illnesses among the First Nations and Inuit population compared to the national average, the comparatively higher rate of population growth of First Nation and Inuit, and provincial/territorial health reforms which were resulting in a shift from hospital-based to community-based health care. These health status, demographic and health reform changes meant that a higher proportion of First Nations and Inuit of all ages were in need of home care services.<sup><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn6" id="fnb6-ref"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>6</a></sup></p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>The <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> Program is not administered in the same manner for Inuit as it was for First Nations. First Nations communities receive funds through contribution agreements signed with the First Nations and Inuit Health Branch (<abbr>FNIHB</abbr>). According to these agreements, First Nations are required to provide annual information via the <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr>’s <abbr title="Electronic Service Delivery Reporting Template">e-SDRT</abbr> (electronic service delivery reporting template). However, for Inuit living in Inuit communities (with the exception of those in Nunatsiavut, Labrador and Nunavik, Quebec), the program is managed directly by the Territorial governments. Although some reporting was done by the latter, it was not as detailed as the information available from the <abbr title="Electronic Service Delivery Reporting Template">e-SDRT</abbr>. As a result, when referring to the <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> in this document, the information largely refers to First Nations and not Inuit, unless specifically mentioned. It is also worth noting here that the Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada (<abbr>AANDC</abbr>)Assisted Living: In-Home Services Program was not available in the Territories.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<h4>Governance</h4>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p><abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> service delivery is intended to occur at the community level through community governance structures, consistent with the principles of health transfer and self-government. Although First Nations communities are responsible for the delivery of <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> and client service results, the territorial governments of the Northwest Territories and Nunavut are responsible for <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> service delivery for the First Nations and Inuit living in those territories. Within the <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> Program, contribution funding is allocated from the <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Health Branch">FNIHB</abbr> Regional Office to communities/tribal groups/First Nations and Inuit health authorities/territorial governments using the Modified Berger Formula developed in 1997.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>In Inuit Nunangat (Inuit homeland), which includes all four Inuit regions: Inuvialuit Settlement Region, Nunavut, Nunavik, and Nunatsiavut, the home and community care program is administered in a slightly different manner. The Governments of Nunavut and the Northwest Territories deliver their home care programs to all residents regardless of ethnicity. Health Canada’s Northern Region acts as a coordinating body between Health Canada and the territorial governments. The Nunavik Regional Board of Health and Social Services delivers the program to Inuit in Quebec only. The government of Nunatsiavut delivers the program directly to Inuit residing in that region. Nunavut’s program is administrated through three regional coordination centres located in Cambridge Bay, Rankin Inlet, and Iqaluit with service delivery variations between the centres.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>Since its origins, the <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> Program has had partnership agreements with the national organizations representing the First Nations and Inuit served by the program: the Assembly of First Nations and the Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami.</p>

</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>The <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> Program Logic Model (see Appendix 1) outlines the linkages between activities (themes), outputs, and three levels of outcomes (immediate, intermediate and long-term). The five activity themes include: service provision; capacity building; stakeholder engagement and collaboration; data collection, research and surveillance; and policy development and knowledge sharing. Each of these activities produces numerous outputs which are then linked to specific immediate outcomes. The six immediate outcomes of the <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> Program are:</p>

<p>The program occasionally received funding from other sources to supplement its existing work (these sources are not included in Table 1). Between 2009 and 2011, the program received approximately $612,000 from the time-limited National Nursing Innovation Strategy program to undertake activities that enhanced collaboration (e.g., within the communities and with other health providers) and also enhanced the wound-care knowledge and skills of <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> nurses. Budget 2010 provided funds totalling $5.0 million per year for five years (with an option to seek renewal for a further five-year period) for the training of <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> nurses on evidence-based clinical practice guidelines and chronic disease management strategies as part of the Aboriginal Diabetes Initiative.<sup><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn9" id="fnb9-ref"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>9</a></sup></p>

<h3 id="e3.2">3.2 Evaluation Approach and Design</h3>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>The evaluation used an outcome-based approach to assess the progress made towards the achievement of immediate outcomes. The approach included collaboration with key internal and external stakeholders in the planning and conduct of the evaluation, review of technical data and in developing the evaluation report as well as the management response and action plan.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>This evaluation used a non-experimental and retrospective design. The evaluation was non-experimental because evidence on the progress toward the achievement of expected outcomes was observational in nature. Furthermore, not only did the evaluation require a retrospective design because the data was based on past years of funding, but it also used a retrospective design because there was an absence of baseline data.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<h3 id="e3.3">3.3 Data Collection and Analysis Methods</h3>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>Information on the data collection and analysis methods are summarized below and provided in detail in Appendix 2. A total of 415 individuals from all provinces and territories provided input to the evaluation through interviews, an online stakeholder survey and case studies of key issues. These individuals included staff of Health Canada and the communities delivering the program, staff delivering other community programs, Band Chiefs and Council and their designates, national and regional Aboriginal organizations, non-governmental organizations, provincial/territorial governments and regional health authorities.</p>

<h4>Literature, Document and Database Reviews</h4>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>Literature was defined broadly as information from sources external to the <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> Program, including both peer-reviewed and grey literature. A total of 40 documents were included in the literature review. A total of 47 internal <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> Program documents (i.e., <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Health Branch">FNIHB</abbr> and Health Canada documents) were also reviewed.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>The database review focused on: review of a <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> Program summary report completed in 2012, documents outlining processes and findings from program data quality reviews, and some additional summary tables provided by <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Health Branch">FNIHB</abbr> that aligned data to the evaluation indicators. The main sources used were two <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> tools: the Electronic Human Resource Tracking Tool (<abbr>e-HRTT</abbr>) and the Electronic Service Delivery Reporting Template (<abbr>e-SDRT</abbr>).</p>

<p><strong>The <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> Program continues to address a demonstrable need for home care and community services among First Nations and Inuit. The program design and funding was responsive to essential home care needs. However, the needs related to First Nation and Inuit home and community care are expected to increase and become increasingly more complex. These needs include disproportionate disease burden experienced by First Nations and Inuit in comparison to the general Canadian population and changing demographics among the First Nations and Inuit population. As well, there has been a trend by provincial governments to offer community-based health services which has led to earlier hospital discharges and clients with more complex care needs in communities.</strong></p>

<h4>Demonstrable Need</h4>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>The evidence from the literature and document reviews, key informant interviews and stakeholder survey indicated that there is a demonstrable need<sup><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn10" id="fnb10-ref"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>10</a></sup> for home and community care among First Nations and Inuit that is expected to increase in the future.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>The literature and document reviews indicated that First Nations experience higher rates of various chronic conditions and diseases. For example, age-standardized rates show the prevalence of diabetes was 17.2% among First Nations individuals living on-reserve, 10.3% among First Nations individuals living off-reserve, and 7.3% among Métis, compared to 5.0% in the non-Aboriginal population.<sup><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn11" id="fnb11-ref"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>11</a></sup> Other conditions which were notably higher among First Nations adults included respiratory illness such as asthma (10.9% vs. 7.8%<sup><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn12" id="fnb12-ref"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>12</a></sup>), vascular diseases such as high blood pressure (21.8% vs. 14%)<sup><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn13" id="fnb13-ref"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>13</a></sup> and ischemic heart disease with First Nations experiencing a significantly higher mortality rate (155 for males; 75 for females per 100,000) than that experienced by non-Aboriginals (123 for males; 49 for females).<sup><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn14" id="fnb14-ref"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>14</a></sup> First Nations adults also experienced higher rates of musculoskeletal conditions such as arthritis and rheumatism (20.7% vs. 13.9%).<sup><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn15" id="fnb15-ref"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>15</a></sup>As well, with respect to mental health issues, the suicide rate among First Nations was approximately double that experienced by the Canadian population in general (24 vs. 12 suicides per 100,000 population).<sup><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn16" id="fnb16-ref"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>16</a></sup></p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>The Inuit health profile found in the literature was different from that of First Nations with respect to chronic conditions and diseases. The greatest differences between the Inuit and the Canadian general population occurred in the areas of tuberculosis (114 vs. 5 cases per 100,000 population),<sup><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn17" id="fnb17-ref"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>17</a></sup> lung cancer (53-55 vs. 12-20 mortality rate per 100,000),<sup><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn18" id="fnb18-ref"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>18</a></sup> colorectal cancer (18 vs. 6-8 mortality rate per 100,000),<sup><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn19" id="fnb19-ref"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>19</a></sup> and suicide (135 vs. 12 per 100,000).<sup><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn20" id="fnb20-ref"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>20</a></sup>There was some indication that the chronic disease rates among Inuit are likely underestimated due to non-diagnosis.<sup><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn21" id="fnb21-ref"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>21</a></sup></p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>Rates of cancer have been calculated for people who live in Inuit Nunangat (the traditional Inuit Homeland in northern Canada), and compared to people who live in the rest of Canada. These rates showed that for males, the incidence of cancer overall was 14% lower in Inuit Nunangat than in the rest of Canada, while for females, the overall rate was 29% higher.<sup><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn22" id="fnb22-ref"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>22</a></sup>The incidence rates of certain types of cancer (e.g., cancer of the lung and bronchus and colorectal cancer) were higher among both male and female residents of Inuit Nunangat when compared to the rest of Canada.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>The rate of mortality associated with malignant neoplasms (cancer) among residents of Inuit Nunangat was approximately two times higher as compared to Canada overall (which includes deaths occurring in Inuit Nunangat). This pattern was also noted for rates of colorectal and lung cancer, which were both significantly higher among residents of Inuit Nunangat as compared to Canada overall.<sup><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn23" id="fnb23-ref"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>23</a></sup></p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>In examining chronic disease rates as evidence of a demonstrable need for home and community care, it was also important to note that contributing to the level of need was the comorbidity of chronic disease, with significant rates of First Nations and Inuit reporting more than one chronic condition. For example, in the 2008-2010 period, over one-third of First Nations men (35.3%) and women (41.1%) living on-reserve reported that they had two or more chronic health conditions.<em><sup><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn24" id="fnb24-ref"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>24</a></sup></em> There was some indication of increased complexity of chronic conditions given that the prevalence of comorbidity as reported by First Nations adults on reserve with four or more chronic health conditions increased from 11.3% in 2002-03 to 16.0% in 2008-10.<sup><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn25" id="fnb25-ref"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>25</a></sup> Similarly, there was an anticipated increase in Alzheimer’s and Dementia Related Diseases (ADRD) among First Nations and Inuit.<sup><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn26" id="fnb26-ref"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>26</a></sup></p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>There are a number of conditions in some First Nations and Inuit communities that may have impacted their health, as outlined in the evidence from the document and literature reviews. These conditions included: poverty, limited services, isolation, low levels of education, poor housing conditions, food insecurity, low levels of health literacy, high rates of smoking, high rates of alcohol and drug abuse, and high rates of obesity. <sup><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn27" id="fnb27-ref"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>27</a>,</sup><sup><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn28" id="fnb28-ref"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>28</a>,</sup><sup><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn29" id="fnb29-ref"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>29</a>,</sup><sup><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn30" id="fnb30-ref"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>30</a>,</sup><sup><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn31" id="fnb31-ref"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>31</a>,</sup><sup><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn32" id="fnb32-ref"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>32</a>,</sup><sup><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn33" id="fnb33-ref"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>33</a>,</sup><sup><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn34" id="fnb34-ref"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>34</a></sup> For example, one-third of First Nations adults living on-reserve (33%) indicated that they had a 2007 income of less than $10,000, with 17% living in a household with total 2007 income of less than $10,000.

<p>Demographic trend evidence from the literature and document reviews suggested that the need for home and community care services is likely to continue to increase given the projected shifts among the First Nations and Inuit populations. Projections indicate significant on-reserve and Inuit population growth over the next 15 years. One study indicated that the First Nations populations living on-reserve aged 45 and over, which represents the majority of home and community care clients, will represent over 30% of the on-reserve population by 2026 compared to 21% in 2006.<sup id="fn39-0-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn39"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>39</a></sup> At the other end of the age spectrum, it is anticipated that there will be increased need for home and community care services for post and perinatal care as the fertility rate for First Nations and Inuit is substantially higher than the Canadian rate of 1.61 births per woman. This, combined with lower infant mortality rates, may result in higher numbers of special needs children whose families will require home and community care services.<sup id="fn40-0-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn40"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>40</a>,</sup><sup id="fn41-0-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn41"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>41</a>,</sup><sup id="fn42-0-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn42"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>42</a></sup></p>

<p>The document review found evidence that the trend in many provinces and territories to release patients earlier from hospital settings and to provide more in-home care for the frail and elderly has resulted in an increasing need for home and community care services.

<p>All key informants identified similar trends as noted above, related to the need for home and community care, including the increasing rates of chronic diseases among First Nations and Inuit, the shifts by provincial governments to more community-based services which has led to earlier hospital discharges and clients with more complex care needs, and an increasing need for palliative and rehabilitative care. Similarly, the stakeholder survey provided some indirect evidence that there was a demonstrable need for the <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> Program. The majority of survey respondents (53%, n=147) perceived that the need for the <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> Program has increased over the past five years due to increases in the population requiring services, increased complexity of cases, and faster hospital discharge times.</p>

<h4>Responsiveness to the Needs of First Nations and Inuit</h4>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>The evidence from the document and database reviews, key informant interviews and stakeholder survey indicated the <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> Program is responsive to the essential home care needs of First Nations and Inuit that it was designed to address. However, the needs related to First Nation and Inuit home and community care are expected to increase and to become increasingly more complex. Program data indicated that over a three year period from 2008-09 to 2010-11, the <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> Program was responsive by providing approximately 7.8 million hours of services.<sup id="fn48-0-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn48"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>48</a></sup> Across the three year period, program funding was stable and the number of hours provided each year also remained relatively constant, averaging approximately 2.6 million hours per year.<sup id="fn49-2-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn49"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>49</a></sup> Another indicator of program responsiveness relates to the amount of time services were not able to be provided. This happens when appointments are scheduled but do not take place due to a range of issues such the environment of the scheduled appointment was deemed unsafe or the client refused the service. There were approximately 123,000 hours of service (only 1.5 %) not provided over the three year period.<sup id="fn50-0-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn50"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>50</a></sup></p>

<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>Key informants and survey respondents stated that the <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> Program is responsive to the needs of First Nations and Inuit but that changes could be made to make it even more responsive. Essential services are being provided in most communities, according to almost all Band informants and most Health Canada key informants. The exception noted was for smaller communities that were not able to provide all the essential services due to their more limited program funding level.<sup id="fn51-0-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn51"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>51</a></sup> It was noted by Health Canada informants that the program policy required communities to have a population of 500 or more to receive approval for funding in order to ensure an adequate staffing level for the program. This was resisted by some communities who preferred to deliver their own program and in some regions it was challenging to cluster small remote communities to deliver the program. Consequently, the policy allowed for some flexibility so that smaller communities could deliver the essential elements of the program in order to address the home care needs of community members. Data provided by <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Health Branch">FNIHB</abbr> indicated that, currently, 151 communities with a population of less than 500 have their own funding agreement. This represents about one-quarter (23%) of the 657 communities being provided with <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> services.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>Most Band and Health Canada key informants indicated that the <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> Program is providing these essential home care services to a large or very large extent, with the exception of smaller communities with less program funding. Similarly, the majority of survey respondents (53%, n=173) reported that the <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> Program meets the essential home care needs to a large or very large extent. An additional sizeable proportion of respondents (38%, n=124) indicated that the program somewhat meets the needs.</p>

<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>None of the key informants indicated that the <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> supportive services (rehabilitation and other therapies; in-home palliative care; adult day care; meal programs; in-home mental health; and specialized health promotion) are provided with <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> funding. <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> Program representatives indicated that the Government of Nunavut uses <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> funds for these activities. Key informants observed that the communities that provide the <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> supportive services do so primarily with funding from other federal programs or with funding/assistance from provinces via regional health authorities and/or internal community-based sources.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>Key informants and survey respondents identified areas where the program could be improved to respond to these trends.

<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p><strong>There was some evidence of progress made towards increasing the capacity (knowledge, skills and abilities) of the home and community care workforce as a result of the increased clinical training for nurses.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>The capacity of home and community care nurses has been augmented through other <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Health Branch">FNIHB</abbr> initiatives that provided funding to <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> to better serve home and community care clients. For example, the Aboriginal Diabetes Initiative provided funds for training to home care nurses (<abbr title="Registered Nurses">RNs</abbr> and <abbr title="Licensed Practical Nurses">LPNs</abbr>) on evidence-based clinical practice guidelines and chronic disease management strategies. A Health Canada key informant indicated that to date approximately 500 home care nurses had been trained as a result of this initiative.

</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>Also, since 2009, through National Nursing Innovation Strategy Program funding to <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr>, some regions have been resourced to provide consulting services and training for <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> community staff on current practices in wound continence and stomal care management in order to allow clients to recover quickly, use resources more effectively and allow the client to remain in their home community.<sup id="fn69-0-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn69"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>69</a></sup> This new support was identified by a few Health Canada and Band key informants as needed and effective.

There has been no similar allocation for training of non-nursing staff (e.g., personal care workers) over the evaluation period. All key informants who commented on training mentioned that there is a continued training need for nurses as well as for personal care workers due to staff turnover and the need to keep up with emerging best practices.

<h4>Immediate Outcome #3: Increased Collaboration with Internal and External Providers</h4>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p><strong>Progress was made towards increasing the engagement and collaboration of <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> staff with other health care providers within and outside communities. Efforts to increase collaboration with social programs (e.g., social services, social workers, <abbr title="Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada">AANDC</abbr> Assisted Living In-Home Care Component, and housing) were viewed as somewhat less effective overall. The linkages with social programs were considered stronger in communities where health and social programs were managed in one department or co-located.</strong></p>

<p>Linkages and referrals to other health and social service providers were an essential element under the <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> Program in order to ensure there was continuity of care provided to the clients of home and community care services.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>Evidence of linkages included, for example, collaboration with external service providers. The key informant interviews and the stakeholder survey provided evidence that <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> staff in a majority of sampled communities have established informal, and to a lesser extent, formal collaborative arrangements with external health care providers regarding coordination of care and access to provincial health services for community members. Most Band informants indicated they had informal collaborative arrangements while some had formal arrangements/agreements with external service providers (primarily regional health authorities) regarding health service delivery. Approximately three-quarters of survey respondents reported that their community had formal or informal collaborative delivery agreements for health service delivery with external providers. Most Health Canada regional informants indicated communities had predominately informal arrangements.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>The key informant interviews indicated some increase in the level of collaboration over the evaluation period due to efforts at the community and regional levels. A few Health Canada informants cited formalized processes (e.g., provincial-level working groups or tripartite agreements in four regions) and pilot projects (e.g., electronic record, <abbr title="Inter-Resident Assessment Instrument Home Care">interRAI HC</abbr><sup id="fn71-0-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn71"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>71</a></sup> [Inter-Resident Assessment Instrument Home Care] tool, discharge planning kit) that were implemented over the evaluation period to improve collaboration with external providers. Similarly, some provincial/territorial/regional informants cited their initiatives to build linkages with Health Canada and community-level <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> staff. Key informants who had higher satisfaction levels with their linkages to external service providers made more progress in developing collaborative arrangements. As well, some survey respondents reported that effective linkages were in place between <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> Program community staff and external health care providers to a large or very large extent.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>Further evidence of linkages included collaboration with internal health care providers. Evidence from documents and key informant interviews indicated that there were national and regional efforts under the period of evaluation to support integrated health program planning and joint staff training. This led to more collaboration of <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> staff with other health staff in at least some communities. In 2008, implementation began of a Non-Insured Health Benefit <abbr>(NIHB</abbr>)<sup id="fn72-0-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn72"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>72</a></sup>Home and Community Care Nurse Authorizer Ordering Process under which RNs were able to order medical supplies and equipment from a physician or nurse practitioner for eligible <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> clients.

</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>Most key informants were satisfied with the linkages of <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> staff with other health programs within communities. Similarly, many survey respondents (56%, n=174) reported that effective linkages were in place between <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> Program community staff and other health programs in the community to a large or very large extent.</p>
</div>

<h5>Immediate Outcome #4: Increased Use of Policies, Standards, Guidelines and Best Practices in Service Delivery</h5>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p><strong>Overall, there was a high level of usage of policies, standards, guidelines and best practices by communities in the delivery of the <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> Program. It is anticipated that national initiatives developed during the evaluation period will enhance use at the regional and local levels. Factors associated with increased use included higher levels of regional capacity to deliver the program and integrated delivery of programming.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p><abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> standards and policies have been in place since the introduction of the program. In 2000, communities were provided with standards and policy templates as part of the Planning Resource Kit to assist them in developing standards and policies tailored to their community’s <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> service delivery plan. Communities funded to deliver the <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> Program were required to develop, monitor and revise standards of care on an ongoing basis to ensure clients received appropriate services. <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Health Branch">FNIHB</abbr> completed an update of the standards and templates in 2012 which is now in translation and scheduled for distribution in 2013. These will be disseminated to home and community care staff in communities along with the Quality Resource Kit (described in evidence for Intermediate Outcome 4) as a comprehensive tool to support quality program delivery.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>Program documents indicated that the number of First Nations organizations with accredited home care programs under Accreditation Canada’s home care or community health standards rose from 38 in 2008 to 58 in 2011. Assuming approximately 600 First Nations communities are delivering the <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> Program, this represents an increase from 6% to 10% of communities with accredited home care programs over most of the evaluation period.</p>

<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>In regard to best practices, over the evaluation period, <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Health Branch">FNIHB</abbr> funded the compilation of <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> case studies from all eight regions and the publication of two reports aimed at promoting the sharing and adoption of effective practices at the community level.

<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>Evidence from the key informant interviews and stakeholder survey indicated that various policy tools are in place and used in a majority of communities. Most Band informants indicated that they have and use <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> Program policies, standards, guidelines, incident and occurrence reporting processes, and complaints processes. Similarly, most Health Canada informants who commented indicated that most Bands in their regions have policies in place and use these, have incident and occurrence processes in place (but that usage varies), and that complaints processes are in place and used regularly. A majority of survey respondents (65%, n=170) reported that policies, standards, guidelines, and best practices information are used in delivering <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> services to a large or very large extent. Approximately one-half of the survey respondents (55%, n=139) indicated that processes for incident and occurrence reporting were in place to a large or very large extent (55%, n=139), as were processes to manage home and community care complaints and appeals (46%, n=115).</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>Most Band informants reported that there had been no change in the use of policies and best practices over the evaluation period, while half of the Health Canada informants reported that there is now more focus on this aspect of services by <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> community staff, due to the greater focus within Health Canada on policies and quality improvement over the evaluation period.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>Evidence from the case study on regional capacity suggested that higher levels of regional capacity positively influenced the use of policies in communities. All <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> coordinators and community informants in the regions with higher capacity indicated that communities have improved in this aspect of the program over the evaluation period and that the support provided by regional <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> staff was a positive influence. Most community informants in regions with lower capacity, and all the <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> coordinators in those regions, indicated there has been no increase in the usage of policies, guidelines or best practices by communities over the evaluation period. The reasons given were that regional support in this area has been limited and many communities (particularly smaller ones with limited resources) have little capacity to do this work on their own (an issue which is exacerbated by turnover in community staff).</p>

<p>Band, Health Canada and Aboriginal organization/Non-government organization informants and survey respondents were asked to provide their opinion on the level of awareness of staff who deliver the <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> Program in communities.

<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>The majority of survey respondents reported that program staff was aware of various aspects of the program. A majority of survey respondents (72% n=187) reported that staff were aware of the essential services provided by <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> to either a large or very large extent, 61% (n=161) reported that staff were aware of how case managementworks including referrals into and out of the program to a large or very large extent, 75% (n=199) reported that <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> Program community staff were aware of their roles and responsibilities to a large or a very large extent, and 75% (n=198) gave the same rating to staff’s awareness of the need to deliver services in a way that is consistent with the culture and values of the community.</p>

<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>Similarly most key informants indicated that <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> staff in communities was aware to a large or very large extent of various aspects of the program. Almost all of these key informants gave this rating to staff awareness of the services provided and of the need for culturally sensitive delivery. Most key informants reported staff in communities was aware to a large or very large extent of how referrals work and roles and responsibilities. Some Health Canada informants and a few Band informants reported that the recent increased training offerings for nurses (in particular case management training) had increased awareness among nursing staff of <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> services and of their roles and responsibilities.</p>

<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>Survey respondents and key informants considered the community members awareness levels of the <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> services to be lower than those of <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> staff. These <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> elements surveyed included essential services, how case management works, and the <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> Program community staff’s roles and responsibilities.</p>

<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>A few key informants observed that the program has been in place for nearly 15 years and that community members who need the home care services are aware of the program and how it works. Reasons given for the slightly lower positive ratings for community members included the varied capacity/resources of staff to communicate with community members about their role as home care workers (e.g., some communities have home care staff who wear uniforms to better communicate when they are ‘at work’), community members confusing <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> services with those of the Assisted Living In-Home Care Component services of <abbr title="Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada">AANDC</abbr> , and a perception that those who need the services are likely more aware than the general community population.</p>

<h4>4.4.2 To what extent have the intermediate outcomes been achieved?</h4>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<h5>Intermediate Outcome #1: Improved Access to Home and Community Care Services</h5>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p><strong>The <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> Program continued to provide access to essential home and community care services. However, the needs of First Nation and Inuit home and community care are expected to increase and to become increasingly more complex.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>There was little evidence found from the document and database reviews that indicated improved access to home and community care services during the period under evaluation. Access remained high and constant over the period, with <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> Program data suggesting that, between the periods of 2008-09 and 2010-11, the vast majority of eligible First Nations individuals had access to the <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> Program (97-98%), while all of the eligible Inuit population had access to home and community care services (100%).<sup id="fn78-0-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn78"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>78</a></sup></p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>As a less direct indication of access to home and community care services, the database review found that the provision of home and community care services had remained relatively constant over a three-year period with respect to the number of service hours delivered and the number of clients served. For example, the number of hours provided each year remained relatively constant,<sup id="fn79-0-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn79"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>79</a></sup> averaging approximately 2.6M hours per year. Similarly, the number of clients served was relatively similar across the same period ranging from 11,769 admissions in 2008-09 compared with 10,464 admissions in 2010-11; and 22,511 continued service clients in 2008-09 compared with 23,972 clients in 2010-11.<sup id="fn80-0-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn80"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>80</a></sup> It was challenging to compare this with data provided by Nunavut given the differences in time periods provided and the manner in which clients were counted.<sup id="fn81-0-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn81"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>81</a></sup></p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>The evidence from the literature review and key informant interviews for Core Issue #1 (continuing need for the program) indicated the need for home and community care services in First Nations and Inuit communities is likely to increase within the next five to ten years due to demographic trends, conditions contributing to social determinants of health, and trends in primary care. This evidence, coupled with that above on the stable level of services provided, indicated that while the program was presently meeting essential needs with existing capacity (funding and staffing), the program will likely be unable to improve access and possibly meet needs in the future for the increasing numbers of clients requiring care.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<h5>Intermediate Outcome #2: Improved Coordinated Seamless Responses to Home and Community Care Needs</h5>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p><strong>There were regional and community efforts to improve the coordination of <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> services with other programs in order to deliver seamless responses to home and community care needs, but no evidence was found that significant improvements occurred over the evaluation period. The case studies suggested that the integration of the <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> Program and the <abbr title="Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada">AANDC</abbr> Assisted Living Program - In-Home Care Component contributed to improved coordination and seamless responses to home and community care needs.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>The key informant interviews identified efforts to improve coordinated seamless responses to home and community care needs within the evaluation period. Efforts occurred at the national and regional levels to improve coordination with provincial health programs and with Health Canada’s Non-Insured Health Benefits Program.<sup id="fn82-0-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn82"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>82</a></sup> Efforts were made by <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Health Branch">FNIHB</abbr> and <abbr title="Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada">AANDC</abbr> to assist communities in aligning the services provided by the <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> Program and the <abbr title="Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada">AANDC</abbr> Assisted Living In-Home Component, including sharing best practices of communities that have integrated these two programs. There have also been community-led efforts to improve linkages with regional health authorities in a few communities. However, none of the key informants indicated that these efforts have actually led to significant coordinated and seamless responses at this point; rather, coordination was described as an ongoing work-in-progress.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>The case study of program integration provided evidence that integration of <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> and the In-Home Care Component of the Assisted Living Program has improved the coordination of services, which reinforced the relevance of the efforts noted above to assist other communities in considering integrated delivery of these two programs. Almost all integrated-community informants reported that integration had led to improved case management/assessments and most reported it led to a more tailored approach to service delivery. For example, one integrated-community informant stated that client monitoring by staff delivering the <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> and the In-Home Care Component of the Assisted Living Program provides a better picture of how each client is faring and continuous reassessments result in the appropriate amount of service hours being provided to each client.</p>

<h5>Intermediate Outcome #3: Increased Use of Continuous Quality Improvement, Including Patient Safety Processes, to Respond to Home and Community Care Needs</h5>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p><strong>There have been national initiatives undertaken over the period under evaluation related to the increased use of quality improvement processes to respond to home and community care needs. Because some of these initiatives are currently being implemented, the extent to which these aspects of the program are in place in communities and whether there has been increased usage over the period under evaluation cannot be determined yet. However key informants suggested that recent national initiatives would have a positive future impact at the regional and community levels.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>Most Band informants and almost all Health Canada informants indicated that <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> staff incorporated continuous quality improvement as part of their service delivery. However, less than one-half of survey respondents (43%, n=96) indicated that there are specific approaches to continuous quality improvement being used in service delivery to a large or very large extent.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>There were mixed views among key informants on whether there was an increase in the use of continuous quality improvement processes, including patient safety processes, over the evaluation period. Almost all Band informants who commented on the extent of change reported that there had been no change in these practices over the period under evaluation, while almost all Health Canada informants reported there is now more focus on this aspect of services by <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> community staff, citing a greater focus within Health Canada on this aspect of the program now that the program is established (23%). Some Health Canada and a few Band informants cited the accreditation process as creating more focus on continuous quality improvement processes. The difference in opinion on the extent of change in these processes may be due to timing. For example, a Quality Resource Kit was developed to assist communities delivering the <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> Program in integrating various quality improvement concepts and practices into the design and provision of home and community care services to further optimize the overall quality of services. <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Health Branch">FNIHB</abbr> developed this kit over the 2006-2012 period in collaboration with communities. This was distributed to regions in February 2012 and will be rolled out to communities as a multi-year initiative. A Health Canada informant indicated that this kit has been distributed to all Regions along with a complementary Quality Education Kit (designed to be supportive of this implementation process) and that regions are in the process of providing orientation and education to community <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> staff on these resources.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>The case study of regional capacity suggested that there have been limited structured efforts over the period under evaluation by most case study regions to increase the use of continuous quality improvement processes in program delivery. Almost all <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> coordinators indicated that this has not been a focus of their work (three cited resource constraints as the reason), and most community informants confirmed there has been minimal regional support provided in this area and minimal impact on the quality improvement practices of staff in communities. The exception was one higher capacity region where the regional <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> coordinator described a number of ongoing activities of the nurse advisors that support quality improvement including using the Risk Management Assessment Tool as an improvement tool, helping with chart quality audits, offering program review services to communities on request or as needed in response to issues, and assisting communities in improving data quality. All community informants in this region confirmed that the advice and training provided by the region had been helpful in their quality improvement practices. The case study of program integration suggested that this approach has led to an increased use of continuous quality improvement processes to respond to <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> client needs due to the increased training of staff who deliver the In-Home Care Component of the Assisted Living Program and improved information sharing among staff regarding client conditions, according to established information sharing agreements between parties and/or via the circle of care.</p>

<p>Many Band and Health Canada informants and most provincial/ territorial/ regional informants reported that the program was meeting the essential home care needs of First Nations and Inuit to a large or very large extent, while most Aboriginal/Non-governmental organization informants reported that the program was somewhat meeting these needs. The exception was in small communities which had less program resources. However, key informants noted that the program was not able to be as responsive to the increasing demands for services and the increasingly complex nature of these demands. Informants most frequently mentioned the increasingly complex needs of clients (palliative care, rehabilitation services, increasing chronic disease) and the limited capacity of the program to respond to these needs as the key challenges to providing responsive services. Key informants described a few strategies used in the period under evaluation to address these challenges including prioritizing services to focus more on health care, a pilot project on collaboration in chronic disease management in two regions (funded under the National Nursing Innovation Strategy), collaborating with the regional health authority to access services, and more collaboration with other health services in communities.</p>

All <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> coordinators in regions with lower capacity indicated that there has been limited focus on developing the responsiveness of services and that there has been no change in community capacity to offer responsive services.</p>

<p><strong>The <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> Program developed processes and strategies to optimize services within the allocated resources and was considered to be efficiently managed and delivered. Further efficiencies could potentially be achieved through integration/collaboration with other programs, supporting increased efficiencies in lower capacity regional offices, clustering smaller communities for service delivery, and streamlining reporting requirements across programs.

<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>The Treasury Board of Canada’s<em> Policy on Evaluation</em> (2009) and guidance regarding <em>Assessing Program Resource Utilization When Evaluating Federal Programs</em> (2013) defines the demonstration of economy and efficiency as an assessment of resource utilization in relation to the production of outputs and progress toward expected outcomes. This assessment is based on the assumption that departments have standardized performance measurement systems and that financial systems link information about program costs to specific inputs, activities, outputs and expected results.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>The data structure of the detailed financial information provided for the program did not facilitate the assessment of whether program outputs were produced efficiently, or whether expected outcomes were produced economically. Specifically, the lack of output/outcome-specific costing data limited the ability to use cost-comparative approaches. In terms of assessing economy, challenges in tracking funding within the broader Home and Community Care program for the First Nations and Inuit envelope limited the assessment. Considering these issues, the evaluation provided observations on economy and efficiency based on findings from the key informant interviews and available relevant financial data.</p>

<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>As noted in Table 2<sup id="fn86-0-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn86"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>86</a></sup>, <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> average expenditures were approximately $110 million annually, with expenditures increasing by 3-5% annually over the period under evaluation. Health Canada informants stated that these increases were largely utilized to cover salary increases.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>For the years included in the evaluation, Table 2 indicated that, on average, salaries represented approximately 3% of the amount of grants and contributions administered. Overall, operating expenditures (including salaries) were 5% of grants and contributions expenditures.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>As mentioned previously, the program received additional funding from other sources to supplement its existing work including:</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<ul class="lst-spcd">
<li>$612,000 between 2009 and 2011from the time-limited National Nursing Innovation Strategy program to undertake activities that enhanced collaboration and the wound-care knowledge and skills of <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> nurses; and</li>
<li>$5.0 million per year for five years starting in 2010-11 for the training of <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> nurses as part of the Aboriginal Diabetes Initiative. When feasible, some regions were able to include personal care workers in the nurses training forums to enhance worker knowledge and understanding.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>The original Terms and Conditions for the <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> Program indicated that the program was designed to provide basic home and community care services that were comprehensive, culturally sensitive, accessible, effective and equitable to that of other Canadians and which responded to the unique health and social needs of First Nations and Inuit. Communities were required to deliver the <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> essential services and may have offered the <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> supportive services if resources were available and the need for these services was identified. The design of the <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> Program remained unchanged since inception and Health Canada and community key informants observed that the funding provided covered only essential services in most communities.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<h4>Observations on Efficiency</h4>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>The evidence from key informant interviews indicated that the <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> Program was considered to be efficiently managed and delivered by most Band and Health Canada informants. As evidence, key informants noted that there was a high volume and quality of services provided in communities with only limited resources. As well, the majority of survey respondents (61%, n=153) reported that the resources were used efficiently to a large or very large extent. Many Band informants and most Health Canada informants were satisfied with how well resources were managed to achieve intended outcomes to a large or very large extent, citing the positive impacts from helping clients remain in their homes and communities.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<h5>Processes and Strategies to Optimize Services</h5>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>Both the document review and key informant interviews provided evidence of processes and strategies carried out over the evaluation period to improve program efficiency:</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<ul class="lst-spcd">
<li>The document review identified a few strategies put in place by the <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> Program to optimize certain areas or aspects of quality improvement processes (i.e., service timeliness, use of resources, data management, and risk management). A Risk Management Appraisal Tool was used to assist with quality assurance in determining the efficiency, quality and effectiveness of the <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> services and supports at the community level. This tool was used by regions to review essential <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> service delivery elements and develop actions to address gaps. It was also used prior to a shift in funding arrangements to allow a First Nation or Inuit community more flexibility in delivering home and community care and the tool was used by both regions and communities to review program status and delivery.<sup id="fn87-0-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn87"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>87</a></sup> As noted earlier, the <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> Quality Resource Kit being rolled out is designed to support integration of various quality improvement concepts and practices into the design and provision of home and community care services to further optimize the overall quality of services.<sup id="fn88-0-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn88"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>88</a></sup> Also <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Health Branch">FNIHB</abbr> carried out a detailed review of the two main program databases (<abbr title="Electronic Service Delivery Reporting Template">e-SDRT</abbr> and <abbr>e-HHRT</abbr>) which resulted in an optimization of the accuracy and reliability of the program data.<sup id="fn89-0-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn89"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>89</a>,</sup><sup id="fn90-0-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn90"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>90</a>,</sup><sup id="fn91-0-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn91"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>91</a></sup></li>
<li>Key informant interviews indicated that the program included processes to optimize services within the allocated resources to meet essential home care needs in communities. Specifically, almost all Health Canada informants indicated that the <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> Program funding model and community-led planning process worked well overall to ensure that the essential <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> services were provided. Many Health Canada informants indicated that Regional Offices provided assistance to communities with service delivery planning.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>However, Health Canada informants also identified a number of constraints to achieving program outcomes. Many indicated that regional assistance to communities is more efficient and effective in regions with nurse advisors on staff in addition to <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> coordinators. A few key informants expressed concern with the general lack of capacity of regional offices to roll out national program initiatives that are intended to assist communities with capacity building. A few key informants indicated that smaller communities are challenged to offer all the <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> essential services within the resources allocated and a few observed that the program management capacity of communities varied. A few key informants stated that the <abbr title="Inter-Resident Assessment Instrument Home Care">interRAI HC</abbr>tool would be more efficient and effective than the <abbr title="Electronic Service Delivery Reporting Template">e-SDRT</abbr> to plan services and resource allocations and would improve coordination with provincial health service providers that are increasingly using this standardized assessment tool.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<h5>Potential Alternative Methods</h5>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>A number of alternative methods and approaches for the delivery of the <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> Program emerged that could potentially enhance immediate results at similar or lower costs (however none of these were accompanied by a rigorous economic assessment). The most promising alternatives that could be further explored include: wider adoption of demonstrated collaborative approaches; increased integration of services and programming with other federal departments; and greater use of technology for both delivery of services and training.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>Key informants were asked to identify alternative methods to achieve the same program results. Those considered to be most promising are included here. Promising options were those strategies or approaches that showed positive results and may be effective and transferable to other settings. However, there was insufficient evidence to conclude that they are applicable in all situations.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>Suggestions made by key informants included the use of technology for telehealth, common electronic records across health service providers, staff training, use of the <abbr title="Inter-Resident Assessment Instrument Home Care">interRAI HC</abbr>tool and accessing third-party or non-government organizational services. One example of the latter suggestion is a ‘hybrid nurse model’ in place in one region where a few Bands have entered into agreements with the regional health authority to provide funding for a nurse who then is assigned to work full-time for the Band. The strength of the model is that the nurse has ready access to all of the resources of the health authority. A few key informants suggested wider adoption of current models of delivery relating to clustering smaller communities for service delivery and integrating health programs within communities.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>The case study on program integration suggested that an integrated approach improves the efficiency and effectiveness of service delivery. One positive impact was an improved use of funds through a common set of program criteria and coordinated service times. The other case study on regional capacity highlighted a few alternative methods to increase the regional capacity to deliver the <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> Program within existing resources:</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<ul class="lst-spcd">
<li>The presence of strong partnership bodies with Aboriginal communities and organizations in the higher capacity regions was viewed by key informants as positively impacting the regional capacity to manage and develop the program. In one higher capacity region, a home care working group (with eight sub-committees) comprised of <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> nurses was considered by key informants to be an efficient and effective way of prioritizing and acting on the priority needs of communities, including prioritizing the rolling out of new initiatives and providing community staff with access to training. The working group also shared the results of their work with other regions. Several other Health Canada informants indicated that this working group was considered to be an effective model. In the other higher capacity region, a Health Canada – First Nations co-management committee was in place for all <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Health Branch">FNIHB</abbr> health programs. For this committee, the regional <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> staff members played an important advisory and capacity building role carried out in collaboration with partners. In contrast, the two lower capacity regions did not have strong partnership bodies and the evidence indicated that they did not have sufficient regional office resources to work with partners and also provide the advisory support to communities needed.</li>
<li>In terms of resourcing, one region with higher capacity developed a growth strategy to build sustainable regional staff capacity for the <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> Program. The region reserved a modest portion of the annual incremental <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> Program funds (with the knowledge of communities) to increase the number of regional nurse advisors. The regional key informant considered this strategy to be efficient by enabling the regional office to provide the program support needed by communities in a sustainable manner (i.e., with incremental resources that are sustainable year over year). This approach appears to be one that other regions could consider for exploration with communities that now receive the annual incremental funds.</li>
<li>All <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> coordinators in both high and low capacity regions used distance technology to varying extents to provide training to staff in communities. This helped in particular with access to shorter training offerings.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<h5>Integration with the Assisted Living Program - In-Home Care Component</h5>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>Evidence from the case study on program integration suggested that the integration of <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> and the <abbr title="Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada">AANDC</abbr> In-Home Care Component of the Assisted Living Program improved the efficiency of service delivery for both programs. In the integrated communities included in the case study, the <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> nurse supervised both programs. In some communities, the home care staff delivered both programs (i.e., all are certified to deliver personal care) or one of the two programs (i.e., only those delivering <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> hold a personal care certification). All integrated-community informants who commented on efficiency thought that integration had improved the level of efficiency through improved coordination, improved assessments and case management, and more targeted funding to address needs and staff training. However, the need for separate reporting to Health Canada and <abbr title="Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada">AANDC</abbr> was cited as a constraint to efficiency. One non-integrated-community informant thought that separate management resulted in inefficiencies due to the limited coordination of visits to homes by the staff of the two programs.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>All integrated-community informants in the case study of program integration who commented on efficiency and effectiveness reported that integration had improved the services’ ability to meet client needs. For example, one integrated-community informant referenced the ability of the <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> to serve previously under-serviced populations, e.g., individuals with brain injuries and mental health issues.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<h5>Level of Regional Capacity</h5>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>The evidence from the case study of regional capacity suggested that regions with higher capacity may be more efficient in the use of resources than those with lower capacity. Both higher capacity regions had formal partnership bodies in place. Neither of the two lower capacity regions included in the case study had collaborative models in place at the regional level. The evidence thus suggested that adopting an organized collaborative approach, tailored to the needs and context of the region, was an efficient practice.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>The two higher capacity regions allocated resources to staff nurse advisor positions in addition to the <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> coordinator and evidence suggested that this was an efficient way to provide the support needed by communities to deliver the program. For example, in one higher capacity region, the <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> coordinator key informant observed that the <abbr title="Electronic Service Delivery Reporting Template">e-SDRT</abbr> data quality in communities had improved due to the efforts of nurse advisors that assisted communities in developing their capacity to enter data in the <abbr title="Electronic Service Delivery Reporting Template">e-SDRT</abbr> and that this data was used by some communities in service planning. A study of the <abbr title="Electronic Service Delivery Reporting Template">e-SDRT</abbr> data in that region over the 2008-09 to 2011-12 period<sup id="fn92-0-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn92"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>92</a></sup> found that community level data submissions had improved over time,<sup id="fn93-0-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn93"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>93</a></sup> that some communities had near perfect submissions<sup id="fn94-0-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn94"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>94</a></sup> and that this data allowed for community level analysis. One community informant in that region confirmed that the <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> regional nurse advisor helped with a number of aspects of program management such as identifying trends in services and development of the service plan. The community key informant also noted that the respective roles were clear and appropriate in enabling the community to deliver the FNIIHCC Program (i.e., the community took the lead and the advisor provided the support or approval they needed).</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>As well, the case study on regional capacity suggested that regions with higher capacity provided more support to communities in the delivery of the <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> Program than did regions with lower capacity and this contributed to the efficiency of the essential <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> services provided. <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> coordinators in the higher capacity regions indicated that they had a full work plan of advisory, monitoring and education activities. They also reported more successes than challenges in carrying out their roles. In both regions there was a focus on education in rolling out national program improvement initiatives and the provision of ongoing advice to communities. Community informants in these regions confirmed that the support provided had been timely and helpful in areas such as service planning (including <abbr title="Electronic Service Delivery Reporting Template">e-SDRT</abbr> data quality and analysis) and recruitment and retention of staff. All Aboriginal partner informants in these regions confirmed that the <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> Program was providing timely services and expert advice to communities. All have partnered with the <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> staff to coordinate the delivery of training or provide access to expertise on specific health care needs (e.g., diabetes) and all indicated that this had enhanced the services provided to communities. Regional management support was also identified as a factor contributing to efficiency, with key informants in higher capacity regions reporting more support from regional management for their staff resources and the promotion of a coordinated approach across Health Canada programs in supporting communities.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>All <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> coordinators in the lower capacity regions indicated that, because of their limited resources, they were unable to provide some services and as a consequence they had limited impact on increasing the efficiency of communities in delivering the FNIIHCC Program. <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> coordinators in the lower capacity regions indicated they all developed modest work plans in keeping with their level of staff resources that focused on helping communities ensure the basic, essential elements of the program were in place. Their work plans also set out a staged approach to the rolling out of national program improvement initiatives so these were not overwhelming to communities that in many cases were still deficient in the essential program elements (e.g., small communities with limited resources to provide the essential services, poor quality of <abbr title="Electronic Service Delivery Reporting Template">e-SDRT</abbr> data due to limited staff capacity to work with the data tool and challenges with staff turnover). All community informants in these regions recognized that the regional staff capacity was limited but reported there were some self-sufficient communities that did not need a lot of support. They indicated that they were able to obtain the advice and support they needed from the regional office. Examples of inefficiencies cited in these lower capacity regions included the limited capacity to administer and spend all the contribution funds allocated in one region, a high backlog of requests for assistance from communities, and a limited number of effective partnerships with Aboriginal organizations to provide support to communities.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>Key informants made a number of specific recommendations to improve efficiency such as: increasing resources/capacity (mentioned by 38%), integration of programs within communities (9%), and clustering of communities for service delivery (9%).</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<h5>Observations on Adequacy of Performance Measurement Data</h5>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>The lack of complete and standardized performance data to assess all outcomes over time hindered the provision of information to support the evaluation, in particular, data to support the achievement of all the expected outcomes outlined in the logic model.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>The <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> logic model included outcomes that were all worded in terms of increases or improvements to the outcome area which may not have been appropriate for all outcomes. In addition, limited baseline data were available for the outcomes at the beginning of the evaluation period (2008-09) to facilitate robust assessment. For some outcomes, the evidence collected was able to support findings on the extent to which a particular activity was contributing to the current program performance, but not to determine the extent to which the situation/outcome had increased over the time period. For example, while the evaluation found evidence that capacity building activities had taken place, it was not possible to determine the extent to which this represented increased capacity building.</p>

<h4>Core Issue #1: Continued Need</h4>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p><strong>The <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> Program continued to be relevant to First Nations and Inuit home and community care needs.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>The <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> Program continued to address a demonstrable need for home care and community services among First Nations and Inuit. The program design and funding were responsive to essential home care needs.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>The needs related to First Nation and Inuit home and community care are expected to increase and to become increasingly more complex. This includes a disproportionate disease burden experienced by First Nations and Inuit in comparison to the general Canadian population, demographic trends and trends by provincial governments to more community-based services which have led to earlier hospital discharges and clients with more complex care needs in the community. The <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> Strategic Business Plan that is currently being developed with key stakeholders is intended to support home and community care staff to meet the increased demand for services while managing program pressures (i.e. operating within the current funding level).</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<h4>Core Issue #2: Alignment with Government Priorities</h4>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p><strong>The <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> Program aligned with federal government and Health Canada priorities.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>The <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> Program is a mandatory program within the Terms and Conditions for the Primary Health Care Authority First Nations and Inuit Health Program and aligned with federal government and Health Canada priorities as identified in Budget 2008, Budget 2009 and various federal policies and initiatives that demonstrated the FNHICC Program was a key component in the provision of health services to First Nations and Inuit.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<h4>Core Issue #3: Alignment with Federal Roles and Responsibilities</h4>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p><strong>The <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> Program aligned with federal roles and responsibilities.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>The <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> Program aligned with federal roles of the First Nations and Inuit Health Branch of Health Canada which has the responsibility to provide or fund the provision of First Nations and Inuit health programs consistent with the Indian Health Policy and subsequent Departmental mission or mandate statements. The <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> Program aligned with Health Canada’s strategic outcomes as indicated in Health Canada’s DPRs and RPPs for the years 2008-09 through to 2011-12. The 2012 <abbr title="Program Alignment Architecture">PAA</abbr> indicated that the <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> Program, being a component of First Nations and Inuit Primary Care, aligns with departmental key program activities which are congruent with Health Canada’s mandated roles.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<h3 id="e5.2">5.2 Performance Conclusions</h3>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<h5>Core Issue #4: Achievement of Expected Outcomes (Effectiveness)</h5>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p><strong>The <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> Program was delivered as intended and is progressing towards its intended outcomes, including the long term outcome to be responsive to the needs of First Nations individuals and communities through the provision of home and community care services.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>The program has been stable in terms of the services provided over the period under evaluation and has continued to provide access to essential home and community care services. There have been initiatives to increase the capacity of the home and community care workforce. As well, initiatives have increased the use of policies, standards, guidelines, best practices, and evidence-based information which are expected to have a positive future impact on program delivery at the community and regional levels. <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> program staff was aware of the key program areas such as the types of essential services provided, how case management works, and staff’s roles and responsibilities, while community members were, understandably, not as aware of these same key areas.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>There have also been improvements in the collaboration of <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> Program staff with other health care providers; however, linkages with social programs in communities are somewhat less effective. There have been regional and community efforts to improve the coordination of <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> services with other programs in order to deliver seamless responses to home and community care needs (e.g., the integration of the program and the <abbr title="Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada">AANDC</abbr> Assisted Living Program - In-Home Care Component contributed to more coordinated responses to home and community care needs). Although expected, it is not yet evident the degree to which national initiatives will increase the use of quality improvement processes to respond to home and community care needs.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>However, the program may not be able to address the increasing demand for essential and supportive services. In response, a 10-Year Strategic Business Plan for the <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> Program is being developed to set out a path to assist communities in responding to the expected increase in chronic and complex needs over the coming years, within current program resources.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<h5>Core Issue #5: Economy and Efficiency</h5>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p><strong>The <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> Program was considered to be efficiently managed and delivered. The economy and efficiency of the program could be improved through increasing the capacity of lower capacity regional offices, clustering program delivery across communities, integrating programs, streamlining reporting requirements across programs, improving performance measurement and making greater use of technology.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>The evaluation found that the <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> Program has developed processes and strategies to optimize services within the allocated resources to meet essential home care needs in communities. The program was viewed by key informants as being efficiently managed and delivered. Further efficiencies could potentially be achieved through increasing the capacity of lower capacity regional offices (building on the lessons learned from regions with higher capacity), clustering smaller communities for service delivery, integration/collaboration with other programs, streamlining reporting requirements across programs and greater use of technology for service delivery and training. The ability to assess the efficiency and effectiveness of the program was impacted by the design of the logic model and the type of performance information collected against defined indicators.</p>

<h2 id="e6">6.0 Recommendations</h2>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<h3>Recommendation 1</h3>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p><strong>Health Canada should develop options for increasing the capacity of regional offices that have lower capacity to support the efficient delivery of the <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> Program in communities.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>A more detailed needs analysis that identifies gaps and challenges of the lower capacity regional offices should be undertaken, building on the more general factors identified in this evaluation. To complement the needs analysis, further detailed examination of higher capacity regional offices should be undertaken to provide promising practices and lessons learned that could help increase the capacity of regional offices. The options for increasing regional offices’ capacity to implement the <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> Program will need to be tailored according to the particular challenges each region encounters.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<h3>Recommendation 2</h3>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p><strong>Health Canada should continue pursuing its negotiation with Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada (<abbr>AANDC</abbr>)to achieve formal integration of the <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> Program with the <abbr title="Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada">AANDC</abbr> Assisted Living Program - In-Home Component to improve efficiencies in the delivery of home care services.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>In the immediate future, Health Canada should continue pursuing its negotiation with <abbr title="Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada">AANDC</abbr> , if it is a priority for both departments, to achieve formal integration of the <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> Program with the <abbr title="Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada">AANDC</abbr> Assisted Living Program - In-Home Component to improve efficiencies in the delivery of home care services. Health Canada should continue its activities to encourage and support communities that have not integrated the delivery of these two programs to move to an integrated approach. The information gathered in the case study for this evaluation should be used to inform communities of the benefits and considerations in undertaking integration. As well, <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> staff in communities that have integrated the delivery could play a role as ‘champions’ in promoting this to other communities. Health Canada and <abbr title="Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada">AANDC</abbr> should also examine ways to integrate the reporting for these two programs in communities where the programs are integrated to improve efficiencies. On a more strategic level, Health Canada and <abbr title="Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada">AANDC</abbr> should pursue formal integration of the two programs.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<h3>Recommendation 3</h3>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p><strong>Health Canada should strengthen linkages and partnerships between the program and other external social programs to increase collaboration.</strong></p>
</div>

<p>In addition to the <abbr title="Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada">AANDC</abbr> Assisted Living Program – In Home Care Component, Health Canada should work to assist communities in strengthening linkages and partnerships between the <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> Program and other social programs. There have been improvements in the collaboration of home and community care staff with other health care providers but linkages with social programs in communities are somewhat less effective. This would include the development of better linkages with community programming involving areas such as social services and housing. The evaluation found that the linkages between the <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> Program with social programs were generally stronger in communities where health and social programs are managed in one department or co-located.</p>

<h3>Recommendation 4</h3>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p><strong>Health Canada should continue its current initiatives to improve quality program delivery through the use of evidence-based information, program policies and standards, and quality improvement processes in a manner that is relevant and sustainable within current resource levels of regions and communities.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>Health Canada should build on the initiatives that were commenced during the evaluation period in the areas of increased use of evidence-based information, program policies and standards, and quality improvement processes which are expected to have a positive future impact on program delivery at the community and regional levels and which can inform quality program delivery. In furthering the development and implementation of these initiatives, it will be important to ensure that they are clearly linked to both the strategic planning process currently underway and the suggested revisions to the program logic model and data collection process (see recommendation #5). As well, it will be important to consider the potential challenges and capacity required at the regional and local levels to fully implement these initiatives.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<h3>Recommendation 5</h3>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p><strong>Health Canada should revise the logic model for the <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> Program to ensure expected outcomes are reflective of the nature of this health program moving forward and ensure adequate program data are collected to facilitate decision-making and future evaluation.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>The logic model should accurately reflect the activities that are undertaken by the <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> Program including the program development initiatives that have been recently undertaken and planned for the upcoming evaluation period. As well, the anticipated outcomes should take into account the context for the <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> Program and focus on those contributions the program can realistically make to changes in the target populations. This recommendation should be implemented soon, as a revised logic model will be needed to assist with program planning, performance monitoring, initiative development and evaluation planning.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>As well, the program should continue to work with regional offices and communities to ensure that data collection is of sufficient quality to be used for decision-making and future evaluation. These efforts should make use of technology and build on previous program work to build e-tools for data collection (e.g., <abbr title="Inter-Resident Assessment Instrument Home Care">interRAI HC</abbr>pilot in Alberta and the computer assisted training tool on <abbr title="Electronic Service Delivery Reporting Template">e-SDRT</abbr>).</p>

<h2 id="a2">Appendix 2 - Details on Data Collection and Analysis Methods</h2>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>The evaluation incorporated classic ex post-facto design aspects with primary data collection occurring post-intervention (key informant interviews, survey). This reliance on “post” data was mediated to some extent by analysing performance data that had been collected by the program during the period covered by the evaluation. The design did not include a formal comparison group. Given that the <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> Program is a mandatory program delivered in the vast majority of First Nations and Inuit communities, it was not feasible to obtain a viable comparison group. A limited number of baseline comparisons and trend identifications were conducted where possible for comparison. Overall, the evaluation was designed to demonstrate the likely contributions of the <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> Program to the expected outcomes, rather than demonstrate direct causal links<strong>.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>Multiple lines of evidence were used to facilitate the triangulation of data to support evidence-based findings and conclusions. The lines of evidence are described below.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<h3>Literature Review</h3>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>The strategy for the literature review consisted of searching citation indices for both academic peer-reviewed literature (Pubmed, HealthSTAR, Réseau-Santécom) and grey literature (Google, Google Scholar) using six main keyword groupings<sup id="fn95-0-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn95"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>95</a></sup> following a sequential Boolean logic search process. Identification of potentially relevant literature was also supplemented with a “rolling reference” system, whereby potentially relevant literature referenced in one document, or identified via other evaluation methods such as key informant interviews or on-line consultation was considered for inclusion in the literature review. Potentially relevant literature was assessed for inclusion in the review according to the following criteria: 1) focused on services, programs, initiatives or policies within the 2008-2012 timeframe; 2) focused on programs/initiatives comparable to the <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> Program with respect to target population, settings, and types of services provided; and 3) topics/themes covered related directly to at least one of the indicators outlined in the evaluation matrix for the literature review. In total, 67 potential documents were identified and assessed using the criteria. Forty (n=40) met the literature selection criteria and were included in the literature review. All retained literature was reviewed using a template specifically developed for the evaluation that aligned evidence retrieved from articles with specific indicators and interpretations for the evaluation. The template was pre-tested and calibrated with two project team reviewers reviewing three articles who attained a reasonable level of inter-rater reliability for coding of key pieces of extracted evidence (Kappa = 0.80).</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<h3>Document Review</h3>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>The search strategy for the document review was conducted initially by <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Health Branch">FNIHB</abbr> representatives to identify internally produced documents and reports that could potentially be used to address the various evaluation questions. The external consultant then assessed each potential document for inclusion in the document review according to the following criteria: 1) the document makes reference to <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> Program activities/outcomes within the time evaluation period (i.e., 2008-09 to 2011-12); 2) the document includes information that provides baseline/benchmark for <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> Program activities during the evaluation period (such as previous evaluations, performance reports, etc.); and 3) the document provides information/evidence that directly links to a specific indicator and can be linked to at least one of the evaluation questions. Forty-five documents were identified by the <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Health Branch">FNIHB</abbr> representatives, and 42 were assessed as relevant for inclusion in the document review. An additional 5 documents that met the inclusion criteria were identified through key informant interviews and included in the review. Therefore, 47 total documents (n=47) met the inclusion criteria and were reviewed in the document review. Similar to the literature review, a document review template specifically developed for the evaluation that aligned evidence retrieved from documents with specific indicators and interpretations for the evaluation. The template was pre-tested and calibrated with two project team reviewers reviewing three documents who attained a reasonable level of inter-rater reliability for coding of key pieces of extracted evidence according to indicators (Kappa = 0.82).</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<h3>Database Review</h3>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>For the database review, the project team reviewed a summary report along with some additional summary tables provided by the <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> Program representatives who compiled tables to align with indicators outlined in the evaluation matrix. The main sources used to compile the summary data report and summary tables were the Electronic Human Resource Tracking Tool (<abbr>e-HRTT</abbr>) and the Electronic Service Delivery Reporting Template (<abbr>e-SDRT</abbr>). The <abbr title="Electronic Human Resource Tracking Tool">e-HRTT</abbr> is an Excel-based tool that allows <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> personnel to provide information on the program’s human resources. The <abbr title="Electronic Service Delivery Reporting Template">e-SDRT</abbr> is also an Excel-based tool that allows <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> personnel to provide information on their activities. Similar to the other reviews, a database review template was developed that aligned evidence retrieved from the summary report and the summary tables with specific indicators and interpretations for the evaluation. The template was pre-tested and calibrated with two project team reviewers reviewing three tables who attained a reasonable level of inter-rater reliability for coding of key pieces of extracted evidence according to indicators (Kappa = 0.88).</p>

<h3>Key Informant Interviews</h3>

<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>Using a purposive sampling approach, key informants were selected from a population list of 1033 individuals developed by <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> Program representatives covering five groups at the national level and in the seven Health Canada Regions. Sampling for the proxy group representing <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> Program clients (i.e., Band Chief and Council or designates such as Health Directors) was carried out to select a representative sample of communities and regions based on taking into account total First Nations/ Inuit population in each region, population size of community, and community isolation/remoteness.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Health Branch">FNIHB</abbr> National Office applied these criteria to all seven regions, based on their knowledge of the regions. Based on this input, the consultants selected two regions that met the most criteria as high capacity regions and two regions that met the most criteria as low capacity regions. This sample of four of the seven regions was deemed to be sufficient to illustrate the different experiences and outcomes across regions using this case study method.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>The external consultants then collaborated with the regional <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> coordinator in each of these regions to identify key informants to interview for the case study: <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> coordinators in two communities, the regional manager for the <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> Program, a partner from within Health Canada and an external partner with whom the <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> Program staff liaise in delivery of the program. All four <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> regional coordinators provided their most recent work plans and any other documents they considered relevant to the case study.</p>

<h5>Theme 2: Program Integration</h5>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>Health Canada <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> regional coordinators in the seven regions were asked to identify communities that had integrated the delivery of the <abbr title="First Nations and Inuit Home and Community Care">FNIHCC</abbr> Program and the In-Home Care Component of the Assisted Living Program and those that had not based on their knowledge of communities. Five of the seven regions identified communities that had integrated program delivery. The consultants selected an integrated community and a non-integrated community in each of these five regions, with a mix of small and large communities across the five regions, with the aim of including 10 communities overall for the case study. A total of eight communities agreed to participate within the timeframe established for this method which included five integrated communities and three non-integrated communities.</p>

<p>The table below sets out the total targeted and completed interviews for each case study, by key informant group. In categories where the targeted interviews were not completed, the reason was due to not being able to reach and arrange an interview with the key informants identified within the timeframe set for this evaluation method.</p>

<p>Interviews were conducted by telephone using a semi-structured interview guide tailored for each informant group and linked to the evaluation questions. The guide was pre-tested with each group. The pretest resulted in minor changes to wording and positioning of questions. Interviews were conducted in respondents’ preferred official language. The interviews were recorded with key informants’ permission, and the notes were sent to each informant for validation. Interviews were conducted between November 14 and December 6, 2012.</p>

<h3>Data Analysis Approach</h3>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<p>In accordance with best practices in evaluation, multiple lines of evidence were used including primary and secondary, qualitative and quantitative data. The data collected was analyzed using the following procedures:</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
<ul class="lst-spcd">
<li>Systematic review of data gathered through each line of evidence, using templates to gather and interpret the evidence from each source (e.g. document, key informant) for each indicator.</li>
<li>Statistical analysis where counts and percentages were generated to analyze quantitative.</li>
<li>Surveillance of data and preparation of charts to record the proportion of key informants expressing specific opinions.</li>
<li>Thematic analysis of the key informant interviews and open-ended survey responses in relation to the evaluation indicators/questions.</li>
<li>Triangulation of data gathered from the literature, document and database reviews.</li>
<li>Reviews, key informant interviews, stakeholder survey, and case studies to identify the extent to which the lines of evidence corroborated findings.</li>
<li>The inclusion of economy/efficiency assessment measures.</li>

<p>In the logic model there is a fourth intermediate outcome identified as “increased effectiveness of services”. It is noted that effectiveness is generally interpreted as the extent to which a program is achieving <em>all</em> of the expected outcomes, and is assessed under program performance. As a result, effectiveness of services is being evaluated under the rubric of performance.</p>
