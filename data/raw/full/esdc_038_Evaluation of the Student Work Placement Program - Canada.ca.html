<section>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The Student Work Placement Program provides wage-subsidies to employers, across Canada, to create work-integrated learning opportunities for post-secondary students. The  program is funded by Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC) and it is  delivered by a selection of third party organizations. The program’s Logic  Model is included in Annex A. Additionally, ESDC’s Performance Measurement and  Evaluation Committee approved the evaluation questions, attached in Annex B,  and the Evaluability Assessment in September 2020.</p>
<p>This formative evaluation (Phase I) has been conducted in the early stages of the program delivery and has examined the program’s relevance, initial design, delivery features and early achievements. It covers the period from program’s inception in 2017 to August 2020. Phase II will be conducted in 2023 and 2024 and will  examine the longer term impacts of the program. The details of the lines of evidence used for this evaluation, including their limitations as well as the  evaluation’s methodology, can be found in Annex C.</p>
<p>The following sections identify the key findings from the evaluation and the associated recommendations.</p>

<h3>Key findings summary</h3>
<ol>
<li>There is an ongoing need for the Student Work Placement Program to support a better alignment between the skills of post-secondary students and the evolving needs of employers in Canada.  Moreover, employers want the program to become permanent</li>
<li>The program created 11,952 work-integrated learning opportunities during the evaluation period and filled a program gap through its unique design and delivery features. In fact, the large majority of students and employers were satisfied or very satisfied with the program.  However, the onboarding and supervision of new students as well as the  additional administration were perceived as an added burden by employers</li>
<li>The large majority of students and employers  reported that students’ participation in the program resulted in the improvement  in their work ready skills, including critical-thinking, oral communication,  problem solving skills and time management</li>
<li>As a result of participating in the program, the  majority of employers would consider using work placements in the future as  well as hiring some of the program’s placement students on a long-term basis.  In fact, 36% of the students who were interviewed had been offered a job in  their field while 20% of employers were undecided or would not hire students on  a long-term basis</li>
<li>All of the stakeholders were satisfied with the  program’s design and delivery features regarding wages, subsidies and the  COVID-19 temporary measures. They also identified multi-year agreements as a  strength that facilitated ongoing relationships and long-term planning.  However, some students, employers and post-secondary institutions reported  challenges with the application process and had limited awareness of training  opportunities</li>
<li>The “net new” requirement and the ineligibility  of international students were considered to be program design limitations by  both employers and funding recipients. The “net new” meant that all new work  placements were required to be additional to those offered in the year prior to receiving program funding</li>
</ol>

<h3>Recommendations</h3>
<ol>
<li>Improve program awareness and understanding,  amongst students, employers and post-secondary institutions across Canada</li>
<li>Encourage the development of “work-ready”  training opportunities, which are available to participants, as a complement to  their work placement experiences</li>
<li>Increase program accessibility by continuing to  address official language gaps related to communications and documentation</li>
<li>Consider addressing the suggestions from  employers and funding recipients to permanently remove the “net new” requirement for employers</li>
<li>Ensure accurate and comprehensive collection,  entry and reporting of data by providing operational definitions of program variables (for example: age, sex and gender, program and field of study,  duration of placement and earnings) as well as technical support including  standardized procedures</li>

<h2 id="a2">2. Program background</h2>
<p>The Student Work Placement Program supports the creation of  work-integrated learning opportunities for post-secondary students of all ages.  They include co-op placements, internships, field placements, or applied  projects and can vary in intensity, location and duration.</p>
<p>"<q>Work-integrated learning is a model and process of curricular experiential education which formally and intentionally integrates a student’s academic studies within a workplace or practice setting and includes an engaged partnership of an academic institution, a host organization and a student"</q> (Co-operative Education and Work-Integrated Learning Canada. 2020).</p>
<p>At the time of the evaluation, the program was based on contribution  agreements with eleven third-party organizations, known as funding recipients<sup id="fn1-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn1"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>1</a></sup>,  from different sectors of the economy. These funding recipients were to:</p>
<ul>
<li>provide wage subsidies to employers that offered  quality work-integrated learning opportunities </li>
<li>create partnerships between employers and  post-secondary institutions to develop new work placements </li>
<li>better align the post-secondary skills training  with the needs of employers across Canada</li>
</ul>
<p>The funding recipients were well established in providing  evidence-based labour market information, training and talent programs to  support vital sectors of the Canadian economy such as: aviation, biotechnology,  environmental, electricity, information and communication technology, mining,  entrepreneurship and finance. Funding has increased incrementally over its  lifespan (Figure 1).</p>

<p>During the  evaluation period, from April 2017 to August 2020, the program expanded its scope and also added temporary measures to respond to COVID-19 related challenges. The design features below capture the program’s eligibility criteria, wage subsidies as well as the COVID 19 temporary measures.</p>
<section>
<h3>2.1 Student eligibility</h3>
<p>Students of all ages who are enrolled in post-secondary education institutions in Canada and are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Canadian citizens, permanent residents, or  persons to whom refugee protection has been conferred under the <em>Immigration and Refugee Protection Act</em></li>
<li>legally entitled to work in Canada in accordance  with relevant provincial or territorial legislation and regulations</li>
</ul>
<p>When the program was launched in 2017 and 2018, the target  population was students studying in science, technology, engineering, and  mathematics and business programs. Starting in 2019 and 2020, the program  expanded to include students from all disciplines.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3>2.2 Employer eligibility and subsidies</h3>
<p>Employers that were served by the funding recipients and  that were able to provide relevant work placements to post-secondary students. They received:</p>
<ul>
<li>50% of the wage cost (up to a maximum of $5,000) for a standard placement </li>
<li>70% of the wage cost (up to a maximum of $7,000) for placements for first year students and under-represented groups</li>
</ul>
<p>Small and medium-sized enterprises were specifically encouraged to apply.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3>2.3 COVID 19 Emergency response plan </h3>
<p>In early 2020, notable changes to the program in response to COVID-19 were implemented and included:</p>
<ul>
<li>an increase in the amount of wage subsidies to  75% (up to a maximum of $7,500) for all program work placements</li>
<li>the removal of the “net new” placement criteria,  which required employers to ensure that all program work placements were  additional to the number of work placements the employer offered in the year prior to receiving program funding </li>
<li>allowing remote work placements and placement durations of less than twelve weeks</li>
<li>allowing post-secondary institutions to qualify as eligible employers</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="a3">3. Key findings</h2>
<section>
<h3>3.1 Program relevance</h3>
<section>
<h4 class="bg-info">Key finding #1</h4>
<p class="h4">There is an ongoing need for the Student Work Placement Program to support a better alignment between the skills of post-secondary students and the evolving needs of employers in Canada.</p>
<p>The 2018 report of the Standing Committee on Human  Resources, Skills and Social Development and the Status of Persons with  Disabilities recommended that the Government of Canada, and specifically the program, expand the opportunities available to Canadians for experiential learning. Additionally, the Horizontal Review of Skills Programming (2019) made a recommendation to Treasury Board to expand the program to include students  from all disciplines.</p>
<p>Recent studies demonstrate that the central role of  work-integrated learning opportunities is to better prepare students for the  workforce. For example, the Business Higher Education Roundtable (2019)  considers work placements to be the “most efficient and effective way to  prepare Canada’s youth for the coming skills revolution.” Further, an emphasis  on soft skills and skills necessary to finding employment was deemed necessary  by the Canadian Federation of Independent Businesses (2018).</p>
<p>The Royal Bank of Canada (2018) asserts that these types of  skills will be important for virtually 100 percent of job openings, across all  industries and that work-integrated learning programs are the only way for  candidates to develop these skills.</p>
<section>
<h5>Students’ needs</h5>
<p>In a recent study, students perceived a gap between the skills they are developing at university or college and the skills they need for their future careers. The largest gaps were in soft skills including leadership, teamwork and creative and innovative thinking skills. Participants,  in the same study, affirmed that there is also a gap between skills resulting  from post-secondary education and those required for successful employment (Lenarcic Bliss, D. and Pichette, J. 2018).</p>
<p>According to an Abacus Data survey (2016), 89% of both current and former students supported more work-integrated learning  opportunities in their academic programs. In fact, graduates who had work  placements, as part of their studies, believed they were better prepared with work-ready skills than graduates who did not have any work placement experience. In addition, 47% of these participants believed there were not  enough of these opportunities for students.</p>
<p>Despite investments made towards work-integrated learning, according to the Business-Higher Education Roundtable (2019), 40% of post-secondary students did not have the opportunity to participate in such a work placement.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h5>Employers’ needs</h5>
<p>A 2019 survey, of 86 leading Canadian organizations, revealed that employers believed it was challenging to find employees with the right technical skills as well as the more “human” soft skills, including collaboration, teamwork and interpersonal skills. They were also interested in building stronger relationships with post-secondary institutions, resulting in  partnerships that would contribute to preparing students for meeting the needs of the future work place (Business Council of Canada, 2020).</p>
</section>
</section>
<section>
<h4 class="bg-info">Key finding #2</h4>
<p class="h4">The Student Work Placement Program addresses the needs of participating employers and students and also fills a program gap through its unique design and delivery features. Moreover, employers want the program to become permanent.</p>
<section>
<h5>Stakeholder needs</h5>
<p>All of the employers, who were interviewed, revealed that their ability to hire more students was attributed to the program’s wage subsidies. Several of them also highlighted the importance of making the program permanent to allow for better planning of work placement opportunities  and human resource management.</p>
<p>All of these employers, as well as those who participated in the exit surveys, reported that program’s work-integrated learning  opportunities made important contributions to addressing their company’s needs.</p>
<p>All of the funding recipients, who were interviewed,  emphasized the positive contribution of the program in addressing labour shortages in some sectors (for example: mining, electricity) as well as feeding into the talent pool of other sectors.</p>
<p>Interviews with both students and funding recipients as well as student exit surveys confirmed that the program’s work-integrated learning opportunities addressed students’ needs related to:</p>
<ul>
<li>learning and improving new skills</li>
<li>understanding early work-related expectations</li>
<li>deciding on a career path</li>
<li>making linkages between theory and practice</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section>
<h5>Unique design and delivery features </h5>
<p>A comparison with 14 other federal work placements programs (Annex D) revealed that the program is addressing gaps left by other federally  funded programs through unique design and delivery features. These features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>focusing on creating multi-stakeholder partnerships between employers and post-secondary institutions across Canada</li>
<li>funding recipients offering training on work-ready skills that complement those offered by employers and post-secondary training</li>
<li>unrestricted participant age and eligibility which allows participation from all disciplines including both full and part-time post-secondary enrollment status</li>
</ul>
</section>
</section>

<h3>3.2 Delivery partner model</h3>
<section>
<h4 class="bg-info">Key finding #3</h4>
<p class="h4">The third party delivery model supported employers’ creation of work-integrated learning opportunities and created partnerships with small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
<p>Case studies and interviews with funding recipients revealed  that leveraging of existing partnerships as well as the creation of new  collaborations with and between post-secondary institutions and employers was pan-Canadian and ongoing.</p>
<p>Funding recipients reported that the program contributed to  increasing access to work-integrated learning opportunities for small enterprises. In fact, in many of the program’s sectors, small and medium-sized  enterprises are predominant.</p>
<p>In some cases, funding recipients “educated” the small enterprises that had not had experience hiring students. In fact, some small  and medium-sized employers would have never hired students without the wage-subsidy provided by the program. For example:</p>
<div class="well">
<ul>
<li>Venture for Canada is focused on fostering an entrepreneurial mindset, and is largely dedicated to creating partnerships with  small and medium enterprises. About 60% of their employers had never previously hired an intern. As such, they gradually increased their capacity to offer work placements by building relationships with leaders in the field, identifying gaps by talking with them and explaining the program</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="well">
<ul>
<li>Mining Industry Human Resources Council serves a sector dominated by large enterprises, but made significant efforts to engage with small and medium employers. This was done by reaching out to new industry stakeholders who did not have the same culture of work-integrated learning as larger enterprises. Discussions occurred about the benefits of the program and resulted in increased dialogue with post-secondary institutions</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="well">
<ul>
<li>Electricity Human Resources Canada created relationships with small and medium employers in regional locations based on the advice of their national steering committee and on feedback from educators and employers. To support these enterprises, the funding recipient implemented  a 30 day pre-approval application process. This process allowed small and medium-sized employers to have program work placements approved, within 30 days of applying, pending their ability to find an eligible candidate. This  supported an increase in the number of partnerships with small and medium  employers</li>
</ul>
</div>
</section>
<section>
<h4 class="bg-info">Key finding #4</h4>
<p class="h4">Funding recipients designed and implemented specific delivery features to promote program awareness and outreach. However, some challenges were noted related to navigating through certain webpages.</p>
<section>
<h5>Outreach and communication campaigns</h5>
<p>Case studies showed that the large majority of funding recipients designed and implemented extensive marketing and communication activities to reach students, employers and post-secondary institutions.</p>
<p>These included traditional and social media campaigns, newsletters and numerous outreach events. Such events included:</p>
<ul>
<li>information sharing sessions</li>
<li>webinars and seminars</li>
<li>presentations</li>
<li>speaking engagements and workshops (often as  part of national conferences and summits)</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section>
<h5>National steering committees</h5>
<p>Document reviews noted that several funding recipients  created national steering committees formed by industry and post-secondary institutions:</p>
<ul>
<li>their role was to increase outreach and awareness of the program as well as to foster partnerships between  post-secondary institutions and employers</li>
<li>they also helped with obtaining up-to-date information on the needs of employers, students and post-secondary institutions and provided direction on curriculum development</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section>
<h5>Webpages dedicated to program funded projects </h5>
<p>Case studies revealed that funding recipients created webpages dedicated to projects funded by the program. Some of them also developed extensive FAQs, application guides for students and employers as well  as created dedicated program portals.</p>
<p>Case studies also revealed that the majority of these webpages were generally user-friendly. Information about the program, for students and employers, was usually easy to locate. However, on a few webpages,  locating specific program information was not always intuitive and some of the information on the eligibility criteria and target populations was inconsistent.</p>
<p>Additionally, case studies discovered that dedicated program webpages are generally bilingual. However, in some cases, not all of their relevant program information is available in French.</p>
<p>It was also noted, through the case studies, that a  centralized and user-friendly website, whereby students, employers and  post-secondary institutions can easily access information on the all of the  program’s funding recipients does not exist.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section>
<h4 class="bg-info">Key finding #5</h4>
<p class="h4">Unique delivery features, also designed and implemented by funding recipients, included application processes and training. However,  variances in delivery resulted in potential limitations for users.</p>
<section>
<h5>Application process</h5>
<p>Case studies identified broad variation in funding  recipients’ dedicated program webpages as well as their application processes.  Funding recipients also had different service standards for assessing eligibility and processing work placement applications. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>48 hours (Canadian Council for Aviation and  Aerospace)</li>
<li>5 to 10 business days (Environmental Careers  Organization of Canada, Information and Communications Technology Council,  Mining Industry Human Resources Council and Electricity Human Resources Canada)</li>
<li>up to 45 days (Magnet)</li>
</ul>
<p>Several funding recipients required a learning plan to be created between employers and student as part of their work placement application.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h5>Training offered by funding recipients</h5>
<p>Document reviews noted that objectives, referred to training  being offered to participating students. Training was intended to support students’ career development and employability skills thereby increasing their  work readiness.</p>
<p>Case studies showed that all, except one of the funding recipients, offered some type of training for participating students.</p>
<p>Training opportunities, however, varied in  format, content, official language availability, cost, whether they were  optional or required as well as whether or not they were created with the  guidance of industry experts.</p>
<p>Case studies also revealed that a few of the funding  recipients offered in person training prior to the COVID-19 pandemic while most  of them offered virtual training.</p>
<p>Document reviews and case studies both showed that the  majority of funding recipients offered technical training specific to their  sector. They also offered essential skills training which had a broader  application across all sectors. The non-technical skills trainings included a  broad range of topics including:</p>
<ul>
<li>critical and creative thinking </li>
<li>problem solving </li>
<li>decision-making</li>
<li>time and stress management</li>
<li>service delivery</li>
<li>career preparedness </li>
</ul>
<p>Environmental Careers Organization of Canada and Mining Industry Human Resources Council also offered Indigenous awareness training.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section>
<h4 class="bg-info">Key finding #6</h4>
<p class="h4">Stakeholders experienced challenges with the application  process and had limited awareness about training opportunities offered by the  funding recipients.</p>
<section>
<h5>Application processes</h5>
<p>Several participants in the post-secondary institutions’ survey as well as interviews with employers and case studies revealed that some aspects of the application process were challenging, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>the inability to apply for funding for more than 16 weeks at a time</li>
<li>a lack of consistency in the application process among funding recipients</li>
<li>difficulty navigating funding recipients’ websites to locate program information </li>
</ul>
<p>The administrative requirements of offering one of the program’s work placement, although not seen as an undue burden given the funding received, resulted in a few complaints from employers who were interviewed.</p>
<p>These complaints included:</p>
<ul>
<li>reporting of the slow release of payments </li>
<li>some other employers suggested that streamlining  the paperwork would reduce administration time, including:
            <ul>
<li>not  having to repeatedly print </li>
<li>physically  sign and email documents</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section>
<h5>Training offered by funding recipients</h5>
<p>The majority of employers who were interviewed were not  aware of any training or workshops offered by the funding recipients. However,  several noted that if the funding recipient offered it directly to the  students, they would not necessarily have known.</p>
<p>Although the majority of funding recipients offered some  type of training, less than half of the students who were interviewed were  aware of these training opportunities. Notably, of the students who were aware  of the training, several had taken or planned to take the training.</p>
<p>Among those who had taken training, impressions of BioTalent, Canadian Council for Aviation and Aerospace, Mining Industry Human  Resources Council and Venture for Canada were positive. There were, however,  two participants who had negative impressions of the courses offered by one of  the funding recipients due to cost and content.</p>
<p>A few employers also mentioned that they have their own intensive training programs for students. As such, they would like the ability to waive the requirement for mandatory trainings offered by some of the funding recipients.</p>
<p>Moreover, many of the students surveyed mentioned the training offered by their employers as one of the main reasons they were satisfied with their work placements.</p>

<p>Participation in the program increased exponentially over the first 3 fiscal years of program activities (April 2017 to March 2020).  In the first 2 years, the program’s eligibility criteria were exclusive to  science, technology, engineering and mathematics and business students.  However, in 2019 the program revised its eligibility criteria to include  science, technology, engineering and mathematics and the arts as well as all  other disciplines.</p>
<p>National distribution of the program’s work placements is  reflected in the two figures below. Figure 3 reflects participation during the  first two years, while figure 4 reflects participation after the program’s  criteria were expanded in 2019. A noticeable increase in participation in  Quebec, Northern Canada and in many of the Prairie and Atlantic provinces can  be observed.</p>

<p class="h4">Thirty-two percent (32%) of all work-integrated learning opportunities were represented by women in science, technology, engineering and mathematics, followed by 18% for first year students.</p>
<p>Document reviews revealed that the program focused on  creating work-integrated learning opportunities for students in the following under-represented groups:</p>
<ul>
<li>women in science, technology, engineering and  mathematics </li>
<li>Indigenous students</li>
<li>persons with disabilities</li>
<li>newcomers</li>
<li>first year students</li>
</ul>
<p>The program offered enhanced wage subsidies as an incentive to employers to offer placements for students who had lacked access to work-integrated learning opportunities.</p>
<p>First year students often had difficulty securing work placements because employers preferred to hire students who were further along in their studies. As such, funding recipients were encouraged to create work placements for students in their first year of their post-secondary education.</p>
<p>Document reviews showed that, out of the total of 11,952 work-integrated learning opportunities, 18% represented first-year students.</p>
<p>Women in science, technology, engineering and mathematics accounted for 32% of all the program’s work placements. Where as, newcomers represented 3%, Indigenous students represented 2% and persons with disabilities represented 2% of all the work placements (Figure 8). Notably,  some students self-identified with more than one under-represented group.</p>
<p>Additionally, funding recipients representing sectors that are traditionally male dominated were committed to promoting gender diversity as well as creating partnerships with employers in Northern communities.  However, some of them reflected that recruiting Indigenous students and students with disabilities was challenging due to their decreased post-secondary enrollment.</p>

<h3>3.4 Benefits for students</h3>
<section>
<h4 class="bg-info">Key finding #11</h4>
<p class="h4">The large majority of students reported that their improvement in work ready skills, including time management, critical-thinking,  problem solving and oral communication, was attributed to their participation in the program.</p>
<p>One of the program’s expected outcomes was that  post-secondary students would improve their “work-ready” skills upon completion  of one of the program’s work placements.</p>
<p>Based on the exit surveys and interviews with students work-integrated learning opportunities were instrumental in improving a broad range of skills and abilities. Due to their participation in the program (Figure 9), the large majority of students indicated an improvement in their work-related skills such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>time management (93%)</li>
<li>critical-thinking (92%)</li>
<li>problem solving (83%)</li>
<li>oral communication (87%)</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, students particularly valued the improvement to their communication and interpersonal skills. This included both oral and written communication with people outside their immediate team, management and with clients. Work-integrated learning opportunities also improved students’ skills in time management, increased their confidence and helped them learn how to act professionally and work as a team.</p>
<p>Moreover, students were able to expand their knowledge and apply and refine the technical skill they learned in school to their work environments. Examples of technical learning include:</p>
<ul>
<li>information and technology</li>
<li>engineering</li>
<li>accounting</li>
<li>marketing</li>
<li>design</li>
<li>administration</li>
<li>auditing</li>
<li>animation techniques</li>
<li>quality assurance</li>
<li>safety protocols</li>
<li>social marketing</li>
<li>data collection</li>
<li>healthcare </li>

<p>Exit surveys with employers revealed both their most and least  valued skills when hiring new employees. Some of these most valued skills are  also reflected in students’ self-assessment referenced in Figure 9.</p>
</div>
<p>Interviews with both funding recipients and students  indicated that work-integrated learning opportunities helped participating  students to better understand workplace culture and technologies.</p>
<p>The program’s work placements were an opportunity for students to confirm career choices or discover other potential career paths.  Some of the students, who participated in interviews, said their placement  confirmed what they already thought they wanted to do after graduating. Some  others said the program’s work placement helped them to better understand their  career interests.</p>
<p>According to interviews with funding recipients,  work-integrated learning opportunities allowed students to discover new sectors  of activity (for example: mining, electricity) that they would not have  considered prior to the program’s work placement.</p>
<p>The program’s work placements were also an opportunity to  experiment with different roles and responsibilities as well as to develop a  network. Student interviews reflected that they believed the program’s work  placement will look good on their resumes and would help in (or has already  helped) finding work in their field.</p>
<p>Information from case studies and interviews with funding partners showed that, in some cases, students continued to work for the same  employer on a part-time basis when they returned to school full-time or were  hired after graduation.</p>

<p class="h4">Work-integrated learning opportunities had multiple benefits for the majority of employers.</p>
<p>All employers reported some main benefits of work-integrated learning opportunities, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>access to creativity, knowledge and skills (72%)</li>
<li>productivity and service delivery enhancements (60%)</li>
<li>ability to address short-term workflow pressure (52%)</li>
<li>opportunity to build stronger connections with education institutions (51%)</li>
</ul>
<p>99.4% of employers believed the program’s work  placements benefited their company</p>
<p>Employers all reported that the program’s work-integrated learning opportunities made important contributions to addressing their company’s needs.</p>
<p>Case studies and interviews with funding recipients showed that  the program was very useful for small enterprises. Specifically, it helped  build capacity on how to work with post-secondary institutions and how to hire  students. For larger enterprises, where hiring students is considered a  corporate responsibility, the program increased their talent pool.</p>

<p>Among surveyed employers, 20% said they would have offered a work placement without the wage subsidy and 41% said they may have offered one.</p>

<p>The majority (68%) of employers surveyed said they would  consider using work placements to support human resources planning in the  future, compared to 8% of employers who do not intend to use them.</p>
<p>In addition to financial reasons, results from the survey  with employers identified a few other challenges to offering a work placement  (Figure 14). Those reasons included:</p>
<ul>
<li>extra work generated by onboarding and  supervising new students</li>
<li>administrative burden</li>
<li>time required to hire students</li>
<li>lack of candidates who meet the skills needs of  the organization</li>
</ul>
<p>More than 34% of employers said their experience with the program increased their overall interest in using work placements. Most of these participants also said that the removal of the wage subsidies would be problematic.</p>
<p>Several employers, who were interviewed, said that even without the program’s wage subsidies they would have continued to hire students at a similar rate. However, the majority of these employers said that, without  the program’s funding, they would have hired fewer students.</p>

<h3>3.6 Satisfaction  with the program </h3>
<section>
<h4 class="bg-info">Key finding #17</h4>
<p class="h4">The large majority (95%) of students and  employers were satisfied or very satisfied with the program’s work placements.</p>
<p>Nine out of ten participating students believed  their work placement related to their post-secondary studies.<sup id="fn7-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn7"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>7</a></sup></p>
<p>Almost all surveyed students (95%) were either satisfied or  very satisfied with the program’s work placements (Figure 15). For many of  them, it was an opportunity to learn and qualified as “excellent”, “rewarding”  and “stimulating”.</p>
<p>Interviews and survey results with students showed that one  of the main reasons they rated their program work placements so high was due to  the support they received from employers. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>students benefited from a variety of supports including training, mentorship and guidance, regular meetings and check-ups and  general support from their team</li>
<li>almost all employers (95%) were either satisfied or very satisfied with the students’ performance during their work placements  (Figure 16)</li>
<li>employers identified students’ knowledge, a broad range of skills and competencies, their added-value and meeting job  expectations as the main reasons for their satisfaction with students’ performance</li>

<p class="h4">The majority of employers were satisfied  or very satisfied with the support received from funding recipients. However,  participants from post-secondary institutions expressed mixed opinions on their relationship with funding recipients.</p>
<p>Surveyed employers were either satisfied (36%) or very  satisfied (39%) with the level of overall support provided by funding  recipients. Only 6% of them were dissatisfied and 4% very dissatisfied with the support received.</p>
<p>Interviews with employers showed widespread praise for funding recipients’ strong communication and response to questions. A few employers believed response times were slow.</p>
<p>Participants from the post-secondary institutions’ survey  expressed mixed-opinions on their relationship with funding recipients. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>those who had Memoranda of Understanding with  funding recipients perceived the relationships positively as it leveraged  strong collaboration and easy access to information </li>
<li>when Memoranda of Understanding were not in  place, post-secondary institutions did not believe they were involved in the  decision-making process and were not always aware of when students and  employers received funding from the program </li>
</ul>
<strong>Satisfaction with the application process and administration</strong>
<ul>
<li>87% of employers who participated in interviews  and surveys expressed high levels of satisfaction with the overall application  process and administration (Figure 17)</li>
<li>Employers also believed the application process  was essentially clear and straightforward. If they had questions or needed  support, the funding recipients addressed these needs </li>
<li>Several of the participants working with Magnet  believed the application process was more difficult and lengthier to complete</li>

<p class="h4">Stakeholders were satisfied with the program’s design and  delivery features regarding wages, subsidies and the COVID-19 temporary  measures. They also identified multi-year agreements as a strength that  facilitated ongoing relationships and long-term planning</p>
<p>Interviews with students and employers reported that they  were satisfied with the amount of either their wages or wage-subsidies. For  employers, this included both the pre-COVID subsidies as well as the increased  subsidies in response to COVID-19. Students also stated that their wages were  sufficient to cover their cost of living.</p>
<p>According to employer interviews, wage subsidies allowed  employers to hire students they otherwise could not have afforded to hire and  also allowed them to offer more competitive wages. This helped attract students  to apply for and accept program work placements. Exit surveys with employers  revealed that 81% were satisfied with the level of program funding. Although,  4.5% stated that they were either dissatisfied or very dissatisfied.</p>
<p>According to interviews with funding recipients, many of  them stated that multi-year contribution agreements are one of the main  strengths of the program. They indicated that these types of agreements  facilitate ongoing relationships between employers and post-secondary  institutions and allow for longer-term planning.</p>
<p>Specifically, without the multi-year agreements in place,  employers were pressured to complete the program’s work placements by March 31st.  However, this is prior to the end of the post-secondary winter semesters. As  such, the duration of placements was potentially impacted. Multi-year  contribution agreements helped to reduce this challenge.</p>
<p>Employers, funding recipients and stakeholders from  post-secondary institutions reported high satisfaction with the changes  implemented by the program as part of the COVID-19 temporary measures.</p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic had a negative impact on creating new  work-integrated learning opportunities and continuing the ones that were  already in place. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>feedback from funding recipients and  post-secondary institutions resulted in the program being able to make quick  changes to the program in response to COVID-19 related challenges. The first  set of measures, including increased wage subsidy to 75% for all of the  program’s work placements was announced in April 2020, shortly after the start  of the pandemic</li>
<li>temporary COVID-19 measures allowed employers to  continue creating program work placements and allowed students to continue  gaining relevant work experience. Virtual work-integrated learning  opportunities led to increased accessibility to the program for employers and  students in remote regions</li>
</ul>
<p>The employer eligibility expansion to include post-secondary  institutions compensated for some of the smaller enterprises’ inability to hire  students during this period.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h4 class="bg-info">Key finding #20</h4>
<p class="h4">The “net new” requirement and the ineligibility of  international students were considered to be program design limitations.</p>
<p>Employers had to demonstrate that each program work placement was “net new”. This meant that employers were required to ensure that all new work-integrated learning opportunities were additional to the number of work placements the employer offered in the year prior to receiving program funding. This ensured that new funding was not allocated to students hired outside of the program.  For instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>several funding recipients mentioned in their interviews that, for very large enterprises it is difficult to have an accurate tally of the students hired the year before. Meanwhile, small enterprises’ challenge was that their capacity to hire students varies from one year to the  next</li>
<li>there is also some confusion regarding the  understanding of the “net new” requirement. Several employers understood it to be an inability to hire the same student for a second work term</li>
<li>several stakeholders reflected that the removal of the “net new”, as a result of the COVID-19 temporary measures, was a positive change. They suggested that it become a permanent design feature</li>
</ul>
<p>The ineligibility of international students was perceived to be a program design limitation by several employers and  funding recipients as well as almost half of the survey participants from  post-secondary institutions.<sup id="fn8-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn8"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>8</a></sup> Some of the explanations included:</p>
<ul>
<li>the ineligibility of international students is a  missed opportunity for supporting the future integration of international  students into the Canadian workforce. Some participants mentioned that, in the  Atlantic region, international students are part of their workforce strategy</li>
</ul>
<p>In some fields of study, there is a strong presence of  international students. For example, between 2010 and 2011 to 2018 and 2019,  enrollments of international students in Canadian science, technology,  engineering and mathematics programs more than doubled from 12% in 2010 and 2011  to 29% in 2018 and 2019.<sup id="fn9-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn9"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>9</a></sup></p>
<p>There is an increasing trend of international students  becoming permanent residents in Canada. In April 2021, the Government of Canada  announced a new pathway to permanent residency for 40,000 recent international  student graduates.</p>
<p>A recent study showed that the “pre-graduation work  experience” accounted for most of the earnings discrepancy for international graduates  compared to those of domestic students in the first five years following  graduation.<sup id="fn10-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn10"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>10</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="a4">4. Conclusion</h2>
<p>The Student Work Placement Program addresses the needs of  participating employers and students by filling a program gap and supporting a  better alignment between skills learned at post-secondary institutions and the  evolving needs of industry across Canada.</p>
<p>This third party delivery model supported the creation of  work-integrated learning opportunities for post-secondary students. It also  created multi-stakeholder partnerships between small and medium-sized  enterprises and post- secondary institutions as well as offered training for  students on work-ready skills.</p>
<p>The majority of funding recipients:</p>
<ul>
<li>executed outreach and communication campaigns</li>
<li>created national steering committees </li>
<li>offered dedicated webpages</li>
<li>developed training opportunities for participants</li>
</ul>
<p>The program’s unique design and delivery features supported  an eight-fold increase in work-integrated learning opportunities over the  evaluation period (from 2017 to 2020). In fact, the program also saw increases  in participation in Quebec, Northern Canada and most of the Prairie and  Atlantic provinces. Partnerships between industry and post-secondary  institutions also quadrupled during that same timeframe.</p>
<p>The majority of students and employers (95%) were satisfied  or very satisfied with the program’s work placements. Employers were equally  satisfied with the design and delivery of the program as well. This included  satisfaction with the program’s wages or wage subsidy amounts both prior to and  during the COVID-19 pandemic. Multi-year agreements, which facilitated  partnerships and long-term planning, were also seen as a strength by employers  and post-secondary institutions.</p>
<p>Work-integrated learning opportunities helped the large  majority of students improve their work ready skills. Employers’ assessment of  students validated students’ self-assessments with regard to improvements in  critical-thinking, oral communication, problem solving and time management.</p>
<p>Work placements also helped them learn how to act  professionally, work as a team, understand early work-related expectations,  decide on a career path and make linkages between theory and practice.</p>
<p>Moreover, employers reported that the program benefited their companies and made important contributions to addressing their needs. They were also satisfied with the support they received from the funding recipients as well as with the application process and administration involved in hosting the work placements.</p>
<p>Additionally the majority of employers (73%) reported that  they would consider hiring some of the students on a long-term basis. In fact,  36% of the students who had been interviewed had already been offered a job in  their field.</p>
<p>Overall, stakeholders were satisfied with the program,  however, it faced a few challenges. These challenges include:</p>
<ul>
<li>a lack of awareness and understanding of the program  by students and employers</li>
<li>inaccessible and inconsistent training for all  eligible students</li>
<li>program information not being available in both  official languages </li>
<li>inconsistencies and inaccuracies of data  collection and reporting which limited in depth analysis of the specific  elements of the program </li>
</ul>
<p>Consistent feedback from funding recipients and employers  supported the request to both remove the “net new” requirement permanently from  the program.</p>

<h3>Overall  Management response</h3>
<p>The Student Work Placement Program supports partnerships  between industry and post-secondary institutions, to create quality work-integrated  learning (WIL) opportunities for post-secondary students. Work-integrated  learning  helps students gain relevant,  real-life work experiences and the skills required by employers to secure  meaningful employment upon graduation.</p>
<p>Findings from the Evaluation indicate there is an ongoing  need for the Program to support better alignment between the skills of  post-secondary students and the evolving needs of employers in Canada. The  Program is addressing gaps left by other federally funded programs through its  unique design and delivery, which includes a focus on creating  multi-stakeholder partnerships, and unrestricted participant age, enrollment  status and field of study.</p>
<p>Overall students and employers are highly satisfied with  their work placements. Students are improving their work - ready skills,  employability and their ability to make informed decisions about their career,  while employers are experiencing multiple benefits to their company, including  accessing creativity, knowledge and skills.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Recommendation #1</h3>
<p>Improve program awareness and understanding, amongst  students, employers and post-secondary institutions across Canada.</p>
<section>
<h4>Management response</h4>
<p>Management agrees with the recommendations to improve  program awareness and understanding among students, employers and  post-secondary institutions. As such, the Department will engage funding  recipients to ensure clarify of expectations with respect to activities related  to promote and expand the reach of the program. The Department will also facilitate  knowledge exchange amongst funding recipients on what works and does not work  to raise awareness of programming, including improving understanding of the  benefits of work-integrating learning placements for all involved.</p>
<p>Given the Program is committed to promoting diversity and  inclusion and increasing awareness amongst under-represented students, focus  will be placed on engaging stakeholders to identify ways to improve outreach  and participation. The Department will engage organizations that work with  under-represented groups to strengthen understanding of effective practices and  encourage collaboration amongst organizations to expand reach to target  audiences.</p>
<p>ESDC will also promote the Student Work Placement Program  directly to youth through the Youth Digital Gateway. This six- year initiative  (2019 to 2025) established a Government of Canada digital platform that offers  a single point of access to information on federal programming for youth.  Through the Youth Digital Gateway, youth will be able to search opportunities  supported by the Student Work Placement Program.</p>

<p>Encourage the development of “work-ready” training  opportunities, which are available to participants, as a complement to their  work placement experience.</p>
<section>
<h4>Management response</h4>
<p>The Department will undertake further research and analysis,  including stakeholder engagement, to better understand “work-ready” training  opportunities that complement student work placements. As the Program supports  students currently enrolled in post-secondary education, consideration will be  given to identify gaps in skills development opportunities between the  classroom and work placements. </p>

<h3>Recommendation #3</h3>
<p>Increase program accessibility by continuing to address  official language gaps related to communication and documentation.</p>
<section>
<h4>Management response</h4>
<p>Management agrees wit the recommendation to increase program  accessibility by continuing to address official language gaps related to  communication and documentation. Through contributions agreements, the  Department seeks commitments from program funding recipients with respect to  both official languages when making any announcement, project-related service  offerings, documentation and information for general public use, and  accommodating specific needs, as appropriate including those of official  language minority communities. The Department will strengthen communications  with funding recipients regarding expectations around official languages and  will monitor projects more closely to address gaps proactively.</p>

<section>
<h3>Recommendation #4</h3>
<p>Consider addressing the suggestions from employers and  funding recipients to permanently remove the “net new” requirement for  employers.</p>
<section>
<h4>Management response</h4>
<p>Management agrees with recommendation to consider  permanently removing the “net new” requirement for employers who participate in  the Program. The net new rule states that employers are only provided funding  for the number of new placements they create beyond those that they offered in  the year prior to receiving program funding. The Program has tested the removal  of the net new requirement when it temporarily waived due to the pandemic. This  measure resulted in the retention and addition of employers who had to adjust  hiring practices because of COVID-19.</p>
<p>The Department will explore the feasibility of sustaining  this while examining how to mitigate the risk of creating dependency on federal  funding for employers hiring post-secondary students.</p>
<section class="well">

<h3>Recommendation #5</h3>
<p>Ensure accurate and comprehensive collection, entry and  reporting of data providing operational definitions of program variables (for  example: age, sex, gender, program and field of study, duration of placement  and earnings) as well as technical support including standardized procedure.</p>
<section>
<h4>Management response</h4>
<p>Management agrees with the recommendation to provide  operational definitions of program variables, as well as technical support  including standardized procedures in order to ensure accurate and comprehensive  collection, entry and reporting of data. This would help to provide greater  clarity regarding reporting expectations in funding agreements.</p>
<p>Since the end of the evaluation period, the Program has  started the process of reviewing and streaming the variables collected, and  will be adding operational definitions to each. The Program will incorporate changes into the reporting template, which will result in more accurate and comprehensive data collection and is the foundation for improved analysis and results reporting. Guidance will be provided to aid program funding recipients.</p>

<li>To what is the program likely to help participating  students transition from post-secondary education to employment with the  work-ready skills sought by employers? </li>
</ol>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="annexc">Annex C: Methodology</h2>
<p>The evaluation of the Student Work Placement Program used a mixed-method approach that includes several lines of evidence. This approach ensured adequate data triangulation support robust evidence-based findings, conclusions and recommendations.</p>
<section>

<h3>Scale used to report the findings </h3>
<p><strong>“Large majority or most” </strong>– findings reflect the views and opinions of at least 75% but less than 90% of  key informants in the group.</p>
<p><strong>“Majority” </strong>- findings reflect the views and opinions of at least 51% but less than 75% of key  informants in the group.</p>

<p><strong>“A few” </strong>- findings reflect the views and opinions of at least two respondents but less than 25% of  key informants in the group.</p>
<p><strong>“One” </strong>– findings of one highly knowledgeable key informant</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3 id="h3-1">Document and literature review</h3>
<p>The document and literature review included:</p>
<ul>
<li>program documents (program policies, guidelines,  contribution agreements)</li>
<li>departmental reports, federal budget, mandate letters </li>
<li>recent studies and reports on work-integrated learning in the context of post-secondary education, as well as emerging  employer and student needs</li>
<li>a comparative review of 14 other federal work placement programs identified areas of overlapping and complementarity with the program.</li>
</ul>
<section>
<h4>Key limitations</h4>
<p>The comparative analysis involved a review of the  information provided on the other programs’ websites. As such, insights to  elements related to the program were significantly higher than insights related  to the other programs.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section>
<h3 id="h3-2">Administrative data review and  analysis </h3>
<p>The evaluation team reviewed and analyzed administrative  data from the Common System for Grants and Contributions. Data for the period  between 2017 and 2012 to 2019 and 2020 was provided by funding recipients as part of quarterly progress reports. Progress reports included information on  work-integrated learning opportunities, partnerships with employers and post-secondary education institutions.</p>
<p>Data review included an assessment of the overall quality  and accuracy of program administrative data.</p>
<section>
<h4>Key limitations</h4>
<p>Inconsistent reporting by funding recipients limited the accessibility to and reliability of some of the data reported in the progress reports. This included inconsistent reporting of variables such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>students’ age</li>
<li>duration of their work placement, and their  program and field of study and in some cases, progress reports included  duplicates of:
          <ul>
<li>work  placements</li>
<li>reporting  of sex</li>
<li>inaccurate information (for example: student reported as both woman in science, technology, engineering and mathematics and as a male)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This evaluation team removed those cases as much as  possible.</p>
<p>In some other cases, information was missing on:</p>
<ul>
<li>work-integrated learning opportunities, and employers or partnership with post-secondary institutions</li>
</ul>
<p>The evaluation could not always determine the reasons for the missing information. Additionally in the early stages, most of the funding  recipients were reporting every interaction with employers and post-secondary  institutions as a new partnership.</p>
<p>One of the objectives of the evaluation was to assess early results of the COVID-19 temporary measures. However, the administrative data  for the specific time period was not available for analysis.</p>
<p>Therefore, the evaluation could not thoroughly determine the  extent to which some of descriptive results presented in this report are  accurate. However, it was estimated that they support a valid enough portrait  of the program’s achievements during the evaluation period.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section>
<h3 id="h3-3">Key information interviews</h3>
<p>A total of 65 semi-structured interviews were conducted by telephone or online video, with a diversity of key stakeholders:</p>
<ul>
<li>ESDC program officials from the Skills and  Employment Branch and the Program Operations Branch, including directors  managers and analyst (n=6) </li>
<li>representatives of funding recipients (n=9)</li>
<li>employers who received wage-subsidies to create program work placements (n=27)</li>
<li>students who had work placements supported by the program (n=23)</li>
<li>the evaluation used a stratified random sample for interviews with employers and students. The sampling frame was composed of:
        <ul>
<li>employers who offered program work placements to students enrolled in post-secondary  programs between April 2019 and August 2020 </li>
<li>students who received program funding between April 2019 and September 2020 </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Employers and students were stratified by funding recipients and then a random selection of the final sample was created.</p>
<p>Among interviewed employers, about 63% were from  enterprises, 25% represented medium enterprises and about 12% were from large enterprises.</p>
<section>
<h4>Key limitations</h4>
<p>Interviews with stakeholders from funding recipients included only those who received ongoing funded during the evaluation period. This included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bio Talent Canada</li>
<li>Canadian Council for Aviation and Aerospace</li>
<li>Environmental Careers Organizations of Canada</li>
<li>Information and Communications Technology Council </li>
<li>TechNation Canada</li>
<li>Magnet</li>
<li>Mining Industry Human Resources Council</li>
<li>Toronto Finance International</li>
<li>Venture for Canada</li>
</ul>
<p>ESDC does not have access to contact information of  employers and students. The evaluation reached out to funding recipients to  obtain information. Information from one the funding recipients was not available while contact information obtained from other organizations was not  always complete nor consistent.  </p>
<p>The final composition of interviewed students and employers does not entirely reflect the initial sample structure due to low response  rates.</p>
<p>Due to the small number of interviews with employers and  students, their views cannot be generalized to full population they represent.</p>
<p>Despite these limitations, key findings from interviews with  various types of stakeholders are consistent with those drawn from other lines  of evidence. Therefore, they are valid enough to contribute to program decision  making in the future.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section>
<h3 id="h3-4">Case studies</h3>
<p>The evaluation carried out 8 case studies of third-party delivery organizations to examine specific features of the funded projects design and delivery (for example: application process, outreach, and training).</p>
<p>Case studies used a mixed-method approach that included: </p>
<ul>
<li>a document review of the organizations’ quarterly activity reports available on the Common System for Grants and  Contributions for the period between 2017 and 2018 to August 2020</li>
<li>a review of the organizations’ websites dedicated to projects funded through the program</li>
<li>interviews with key stakeholders</li>
</ul>
<section>
<h4>Key limitations</h4>
<p>In some cases, inconsistent and incomplete information  available in the organizations’ quarterly reports and on their websites limited  the key findings on some aspects of the projects’ design and delivery.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the mixed-method approach allowed for  mitigating many of the limitations. It provided useful insights on how each of  the funding recipients took ownership of and implemented their funded projects.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section>
<h3 id="h3-5">Online survey with post-secondary education institutions</h3>
<p>The evaluation conducted a survey with stakeholders from  post-secondary institutions to gain insight on aspects such as the level of  satisfaction with the program’s design and delivery features, as well as views  on the extent to which the program led to concrete results.</p>
<p>The Interactive Fact Funding Service at Employment and  Social Development Canada conducted the survey between January 12 and February  5, 2021. The questionnaire consisted of both open-ended and Linkert scale questions.</p>
<section>
<h4>Key limitations</h4>
<p>ESDC does not have direct access to personal contact information  for post-secondary institutions. Funding recipients reached out directly to  their contacts to invite them to participate in the survey.</p>
<p>Despite intensive recruitment efforts, only 35 participants  representing 25 post-secondary institutions participated in the survey.</p>
<p>Their geographical distribution was similar to student  placements. However, participants in the Atlantic region were overrepresented.  Notably, no institution in Quebec answered the survey.</p>
<p>These limitations were partially mitigated by the fact that  students from the 25 post-secondary institutions had about 56% of the total  number of work placements funded by the program between 2017 and 2018 to 2019  and 2020.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section>
<h3 id="h3-6">Exit surveys students and employers  conducted by the program</h3>
<p>The program designed exit surveys for students and  employers. The funding recipients conducted the surveys. The questionnaires  includes open-ended and Linkert scale questions. The main purpose of the  surveys was to obtain feedback from students and employers on the achievement  of program outcomes related to acquiring work-ready skills, increases in  student employability, benefits for employers and overall satisfaction with the  program’s work placement experience.</p>
<p>The exit surveys for students were distributed during the  fall of 2020 by their work placement employer. As such, its data reflects  participants’ feedback from both within the evaluation period (April 2017 to  March 2020) as well as post evaluation period (fall 2020).</p>
<p>The evaluation team performed a descriptive analysis of  qualitative results. In addition, the evaluation team pulled out a stratified  random sample of qualitative data. To conduct relevant analysis, the evaluation team used MAXQDA.</p>
<section>
<h4>Key limitations</h4>
<p>The dataset for students included information from 4,106 students. <strong>These program work placements were supported by only 6 of the funding  recipients who delivered the program during the evaluation period.</strong></p>
<p>The dataset for employers included 3,322 cases among which about 1,700 were unique employers. This is due to the fact that, in some cases,  employers filled the survey for more than one student. <strong>Additionally, employers  indicated that they worked with only 6 of the funding recipients during the  evaluation period.</strong></p>
<p>Nevertheless, results were consistent from one funding  recipient to another. They were a rich source of information for key findings  related to the program’s outcomes and level of satisfaction with program.</p>
</section>
</section>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="annexd">Annex D: Comparison analysis summary</h2>
<p><strong>To what extent are the  objectives and design of the Student Work Placement Program meeting the needs  of employers, post-secondary education institutions and students?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>comparison of program against similar programs  based on key characteristics and strengths and challenges (Canadian, federal,  ongoing, ESDC and non-ESDC, work placement component)</li>
<li>extent to which, and how, the program  complements or fills a gap left by similar programs</li>
</ul>
<section>
<h3>Synthesis analysis:</h3>
<p>This comparative analysis comprised of 14 federal or federally funded work placement programs in addition to Student Work Placement Program. The following comparison criteria were used:</p>
<ul>
<li>objectives</li>
<li>target population</li>
<li>geographical representation</li>
<li>grants and contribution and other sources of  funding</li>
<li>funding amounts</li>
<li>delivery model and eligible participants</li>
<li>special features</li>
</ul>
<p>Of the seven analysis criteria, all except geographical  representation and sources of funding demonstrated the program as having either  complementary programming or filling a gap left by other similar programs. For  example, the unification of unrestricted participant age, enrollment status  (both full and part-time) and field of study support both complementary  programming as well as fill a program gap.</p>
<p>More notably, the objectives and the special features of the  program also demonstrate filling a program gap and a complementary component.  The program’s objectives, specifically the focus on creating collaborative  multi-stakeholder partnerships between industry and post-secondary institutions  across Canada, is unique and not highlighted by other similar programs.</p>
<p>Moreover, when comparing special features, The Student Work  Placement Program’s focus on the training of essential and non-technical skills  to complement post-secondary institutions’ technical skills training is an  enhancement to the scope of work placement programs across Canada. </p>
<p><strong>Limitation:</strong> This comparative  analysis involved a review of the information provided on the other programs’  websites. As such, insights to program elements related to Student Work  Placement Program were significantly higher than insights related to the other  programs. A comprehensive review of the other programs, beyond the information  contained on their websites would be required to gain a fulsome understanding  of their challenges. As such, this component of the analysis is not captured in  this analysis.</p>
<section>
<h4>Comparable programs </h4>
<p>The Student Work Placement Program was compared with 14  other federal work placement programs and one non-government, federally funded,  work placement program or equivalent (for example: coop, internship):</p>

<p>This data is also from April 2017 to March 2020. Approximately 5% of the values  were missing for students’ age, and there were also variations on how age was  reported (example: year, date of birth and current age). As such, age was determined  by i) the participant’s age in 2021 and ii) the participant’s age in the year  of their work placement based on difference between their age in 2021 and the  fiscal year of the work placement.</p>
