<h2 id="h1">Executive summary</h2>
<p>This report presents the findings and  conclusions of Pathways to Education Canada, in accordance with the Financial  Administration<em> Act</em> and Treasury  Board's Policy on Results requirements. </p>
<section>
<h3>The program</h3>
<p>Pathways to Education is a charitable  organization that provides after-school programming to help at-risk youth in  low-income communities graduate from high school and successfully transition  into post-secondary education or training. Currently there are 20 sites  providing services to over 5,000 students across Canada. Pathways to Education  collaborates in partnership with governments, community partners, schools,  school boards and hundreds of diverse volunteers to break the cycle of poverty  through education and by enabling strategic, long-term social change. </p>
<p> Pathways to Education funding comes  from various sources, including a named grant of $31 million to Pathways to  Education between 2014 to 2015 and 2017 to 2018 from Employment and Social  Development Canada. </p>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Findings</h3>
<p>The evaluation found that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pathways to  Education programming addresses a demonstrable need by providing support to  disadvantaged youth to complete their education, transition to a successful  future and better reach their potential.</li>
<li>Pathways to  Education contributed to increased enrollment to post-secondary education among  participants.</li>
<li>Adapted  programming in Winnipeg positively affected Indigenous youth.</li>
<li>Pathways to  Education had a direct positive effect on high school graduation rates, enrollment  to post-secondary education and educational attainment.</li>
<li>The program  also positively affected eligible participant's labour market outcomes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Moreover, the evaluation determined  that Pathways to Education programming has a net positive social return on  investment. Using the incremental impacts for Pathways-eligible students from  1 location (Regent Park) over a comparable population of students at  locations not served by Pathways to Education programming as a proxy, the total net social benefit (to both individual  participants and to governments) of an intervention for a single student  represented a return on investment of approximately 50% over 25 years.  Based on this analysis, an investment in the program “breaks even” (where the  benefits equal the costs) after 22.5 years from a government perspective and  after 20.8 years from a total social net benefit perspective.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Lessons learned and conclusions </h3>
<p>The evaluation derived 3 key  lessons learned applicable not just to the Pathways to Education program, but  also other similar programming:</p>
<ol>
<li>Targeted early  interventions positively affect vulnerable populations.</li>
<li>A key component  of the success of the Pathways to Education model is the flexibility to adapt  to local needs and conditions.</li>
<li>Early  interventions with vulnerable populations can generate long-term net benefits  not just for individuals but also for governments.</li>
</ol>
<p>As such, the evaluation determined that  programming of this nature—designed to support early interventions to help  vulnerable youth complete high school—has a valuable role to play.</p>

<section>
<h2 id="h2">Management response</h2>
<p>Every year too many young Canadians drop out  of high school because they lack access to the basic supports needed to succeed  in school. Youth who drop-out of school are more likely to hold low-paying  precarious jobs as the number of jobs requiring post-secondary education is  increasing and those with limited education face greater risk of unemployment. </p>
<p> In addition to helping make post-secondary  education more affordable for students from low- and middle-income families  through savings incentives, grants and loans, Employment and Social Development  Canada has invested nearly $55 million in Pathways to Education Canada  (Pathways) since 2010. Pathways is a community-based not-for-profit  organization that provides youth in low-income communities a suite of  after-school programming, including tutoring, mentoring, and financial  incentives to help them complete high school and transition to post-secondary  education. Budget 2017 committed to renew the Government's support for Pathways  to Education Canada by providing $38 million over 4 years, starting in 2018  to 2019. </p>
<p> An evaluation was recently conducted by the Strategic and Service Policy  Branch's Evaluation Directorate in order to assess whether Pathways was  achieving the intended outcomes of improving rates of high school graduation  and increasing successful transitions to post-secondary education and the  labour market. The Learning Branch is pleased with the conclusions of this  evaluation report, which reinforces the importance of the Government of Canada's  investment in Pathways. The report confirmed that Pathways to Education Canada  responds to the needs of underrepresented learners and generates desired  outcomes. </p>
<p> Learning Branch's response to key findings and lessons learned from the  report are included below. </p>
<section>
<h3>Finding 1: Overall,  Pathways programming is contributing to a demonstrable need by providing  support to disadvantaged youth in order to complete their education, transition  to a successful future and better their potential</h3>
<p>Learning Branch is pleased that Pathways' work to address the  educational barriers that disadvantaged youth are facing was recognized in the  evaluation. Their model, which is based on various types of supports (i.e.,  academic, social, financial and one-on-one mentoring), contributes to a more  equitable participation of Canadians in post-secondary education.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Finding 2: Pathways  programming contributed to increased enrollment to post-secondary  education </h3>
<p>Learning Branch is pleased that Pathways' impact on enrollment to post-secondary  education is highlighted by this report. Given an on-time high school  graduation rate of 79%, and a cumulative rate (since the launch of the  program) of 73% of Pathways graduates successfully transitioning to post-secondary  education, it can be inferred that the overall post-secondary education participation  rate for Pathways participants is approximately 58%. By way of  comparison, a recent report by Statistics Canada indicates that approximately  47% of 19 year olds in the lowest income quintile and approximately 57% of 19 year olds in the second-lowest income quintile participated in post-secondary  education in 2015. <sup id="fn1-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn1"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>1</a></sup></p>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Finding 3: Adapted  programming in Winnipeg positively affected Indigenous youth </h3>
<p>Learning Branch agrees with this finding and recognizes the importance  of offering culturally adapted programming to Indigenous students. Other  Pathways' sites that also serve large proportions of Indigenous youth have been  able to tailor their program as well, for example offering to middle school  students to meet the needs of the community (e.g., Mashteuiatsh, Quebec). </p>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Finding 4: Pathways  positively affected high school graduation rates </h3>
<p>Learning Branch recognizes the positive impact of Pathways on high  school graduation rates. This success was demonstrated through the tracking of  on-time graduation rates before and after the introduction of Pathways in the  community. The introduction of the Pathways program has correlated with a  significant change in graduation in some communities post-Pathways (e.g. in  Kingston, Ontario, the rate of on-time graduation increased from 40%  before the program was introduced to 79% for the 2015 to 2016 school  year<sup id="fn2-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn2"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>2</a></sup>). In fact, an average of 79% of all Pathways'  participants complete high school on time.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Finding 5: Pathways had a  positive effect on enrollment to post-secondary education and  educational attainment </h3>
<p>Learning Branch is pleased with the findings of the evaluation which  used research commissioned by the Learning Branch to demonstrate Pathways'  impact on educational attainment in Regent Park. Since the study that was  originally conducted by Drs. Lavecchia and Oreopoulos, more time has passed and  additional data is available making it timely to confirm the positive impact of  Pathways on participants go beyond its initial site in Regent Park. As such, Learning  Branch plans to commission additional research that would examine the impact of  Pathways at 2 of its expansion sites in Toronto (Rexdale and Lawrence  Heights). This research would also explore the data feasibility of the impact  of Pathways on social outcomes such as reducing health inequality and crime as  well as examining the feasibility of studying expansion sites outside of  Toronto. The Rexdale and Lawrence Heights sites were selected because the  maturity of their program would allow for a better longitudinal view of  outcomes of Pathways participants. Having both opened in 2007, the first cohort  of students from these sites would now be approximately 24 years old. </p>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Finding 6: Pathways  positively affected labour market outcomes </h3>
<p>As noted in finding #5, a small sample was used to consider Pathways'  impacts on labour market outcomes. However, given that the first expansion  sites (Lawrence Heights and Rexdale) are now at an appropriate age of  maturation, Learning Branch plans to pursue additional research to examine  other sites to broaden the sample size and expand on research available on Pathways'  impact on labour market outcomes for students. </p>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Lesson learned 1: Targeted early interventions can  positively affect vulnerable populations </h3>
<p>Learning Branch welcomes the first lesson learned through the  evaluation. Early interventions have proven to be a successful means to  increase academic success and improve labour market outcomes for  underrepresented populations. While the Pathways model has proven to be  particularly effective, the organization continues to be very intentional in  its growth. Their model requires extensive community engagement and takes an average  of 2 to 3 years to open a new site. With 20 sites currently in operation,  mostly in larger urban areas, both Learning Branch and the organization  recognize that there are still many communities that could benefit from  Pathways-like supports. In order to increase capacity, Employment and Social  Development Canada will explore with Pathways and other organizations ways to  address this gap and provide similar opportunities to underrepresented youth  who do not have access to Pathways' programming including youth in rural,  remote, and Indigenous communities. </p>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Lesson learned 2: A  key component of the success of the Pathways model is the flexibility to adapt  to local needs and conditions </h3>
<p>Learning Branch agrees with this finding. The flexibility and  decentralized nature of the Pathways model is critical to allowing the program  to be easily adapted to account for regional diversity and provide culturally  relevant content for students. Most importantly, the Pathways model is student centered  focusing on students' needs and is delivered by local, trusted community  partners. </p>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Lesson learned 3: Early interventions with vulnerable  populations can generate long-term benefits not just for individuals but  also for governments </h3>
<p>As the evaluation found and consistent with research produced by Drs.  Levecchia, Oreopoulos and Brown, it is clear that early learning interventions  with underrepresented populations can generate long-term benefits at both the  individual and societal levels. Additional research including validation of the  results of the aforementioned study by expanding the sample to additional sites  in Lawrence Heights and Rexdale and studying additional factors by including  crime and health data, will further enhance our understanding of the long-term  benefits of Pathways. </p>

<section>
<h3 id="h4.1">2.1 Evaluation scope, methodology, and limitations</h3>
<p>This evaluation examines the extent to  which Pathways is relevant, achieved its outcomes, and the impact it had on its  eligible students. The Department synthesized 3 reports described below to  address the evaluation reporting requirements of the Financial Administration  Act and the Policy on Results. </p>
<ol>
<li>The evaluation  of the Pathways to Education program: In 2016 to 2017, Pathways externally  contracted this evaluation as stipulated under its agreement with the  Department. The report focused on general evaluation issues, program effects  and the design and delivery of the program. This line of evidence applied a  methodology that compared outcomes between Pathways-eligible students  (treatment group) to on-eligible students (comparison group)<sup id="fn4-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn4"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>4</a></sup> and generated qualitative data from key  informant interviews, focus groups and 3 surveys<sup id="fn5-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn5"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>5</a></sup>. </li>
<li>The long-term impacts  of the Pathways to Education program: This is an academic study<sup id="fn6-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn6"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>6</a></sup> prepared  by Adam M. Lavecchia, Philip Oreopoulos and Robert Brown for the Department in  2018. It examined the incremental impacts of the program covering the period  between 1999 and 2013. It compared the outcomes of all adolescents from Regent  Park that were eligible for the program with the outcomes of adolescents from  other Toronto public housing sites, both before and after the introduction of  Pathways. A regression analysis was also used to estimate the impacts on  earnings and employment<sup id="fn7-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn7"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>7</a></sup>. </li>
<li>The returns to completing high school Education: This  Department-generated line of evidence literature review focused on the  economics of completing high school education as well as individual and  societal benefits. It reported on the frequency of not completing high school  in Canada; labour market benefits from completing high school; and the benefits  of completing post-secondary education. </li>
</ol>
</section>
</section>
<!-- END h2>2. Evaluation strategy -->
<section>
<h2 id="h5">3. Findings: relevance, effectiveness, and efficiency</h2>
<p>The results presented in this section  include an assessment of a demonstrable need for the program (relevance); the  effectiveness of Pathways (outcomes); the impact Pathways has had on the eligible  students (program attribution); and, the overall costs and benefits of the  program.</p>
<p> The results of the analyses, detailed  below, confirm that Pathways is making a difference in the lives of the eligible  students. Eligible students' graduation rates are higher and they have  increased their post-secondary enrollment. They have increased their labour  market attachment. The analysis also demonstrates that Pathways' benefits  outweigh the costs. </p>
<section>
<h3 id="h5.1">3.1 Relevance</h3>
<p><strong>Relevance  is the extent to which a program, policy or other entity addresses and is  responsive to a demonstrable need.</strong></p>
<div class="well pull-right col-md-4">
<p> In 2015, approximately 1 out of every 8 Canadians (or about 12%) lived in poverty according to <em>Opportunity  for All - Canada's First Poverty Reduction Strategy</em> (2018). </p>
</div>
<p> Overall, Pathways programming is contributing  to a demonstrable need by providing support to disadvantaged youth in order to  complete their education, transition to a successful future and better reach  their potential<sup id="fn8-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn8"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>8</a></sup>. The  discussion that follows describes the challenges facing children living in  poverty and the consequences specifically associated with not completing high  school. </p>
<div class="clearfix"></div>
<div class="well">
<p><strong>Participant profile</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Gender:</strong> Pathways participants at the  Ontario sites were equally divided between men and women, whereas the Halifax,  Verdun and Winnipeg sites had more female than male participants. </p>
<p><strong>Age:</strong> Generally, when entering Pathways,  participants are in grade 9 and approximately 14 years old at the Ontario  sites. The average age of Pathways participants in Halifax and Winnipeg was 14  years old and was 12 years old in Verdun. </p>
<p><strong>Language:</strong> About one-third of the  Ontario site participants were born outside of Canada and 39% of the  participants first spoke a language other than English or French. Over 30% of participants in Verdun first spoke a language other than English or  French and the Halifax site reported less than one-tenth of participants first  spoke a language other than French or English. </p>

</div>
<p> In 2013, more than 15% of  Canadian children overall, and as high as 40% among Indigenous children,  lived in poverty. According to the Goss Gilroy evaluation report, children living  in poverty are at high risk of developing health issues, developmental delays  and behaviour disorders and are more likely to have lower levels of education  and remain in poverty as adults. This group is also most likely to experience,  among other things, interrupted school attendance, lower university attendance,  increased risk of illiteracy, and higher dropout rates<sup id="fn9-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn9"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>9</a></sup>. </p>
<p> While a minority of the total  population, a significant portion of the population fails to complete secondary  school. For example, in 2011 to 2012, Canada's dropout rate was 7.8%  nationally with the dropout rates for men being higher (9.7%) than for  women (5.9%)<sup id="fn10-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn10"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>10</a></sup>.  Moreover, the Literature Review also suggested that Canadian youth at risk of  dropping out of high school are among the most vulnerable in our society.  Figure 3 illustrates the potential consequences of dropping out of high school<sup id="fn11-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn11"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>11</a></sup>. </p>

<details>
<summary>Figure 3: Potential consequences of dropping out of high school – Text version</summary>
<p>Dropping out of high  school potentially leads to <strong>Increased  incidence of marital instability</strong>; <strong>Reduced  lifetime earnings</strong> and <strong>Increased  unemployment</strong>. It also potentially leads to <strong>Early childbearing, Delinquency</strong> and <strong>Substance abuse</strong>. As well, dropping out of high school could lead to  a <strong>Reduced quality of life</strong>, <strong>Poor health</strong>, <strong>Crime</strong>, and <strong>Economic  dependency</strong>.</p>
</details>
</figure>
<p>As well, youth who drop out of high  school experience lower wage level increases than those who completed high  school, report lower wage satisfaction, and were less likely to be employed by  age 24<sup id="fn12-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn12"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>12</a></sup>. For  example, the present value of lifetime earnings is $129,000 higher for men and  $104,000 higher for women with a high school diploma, relative to high school  dropouts<sup id="fn13-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn13"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>13</a></sup>.</p>
<p>These factors all suggest a continuing relevance for programs and policies designed to help vulnerable youth complete secondary school. </p>
</section>
<section>
<h3 id="h5.2">3.2 Outcomes</h3>
<p><strong>An outcome,  under the 2016 Policy on Results, is a change or consequence attributable to  outputs or to which outputs or other outcomes of the program contribute.</strong></p>
<p> This section focuses on the program's outcomes with respect to  increasing the number of participants entering post-secondary education and  helping Indigenous youth. The evidence presented below suggests that Pathways  is achieving these outcomes. </p>
<section>
<h4>Pathways programming  contributed to increased enrollment to post-secondary education </h4>
<p>Pathways helped eligible students apply for, be accepted to and enroll  in post-secondary institutions. The  majority of alumni survey respondents<sup id="fn14-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn14"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>14</a></sup> and  surveyed staff members<sup id="fn15-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn15"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>15</a></sup> agreed  that Pathways programming helped eligible students apply for post-secondary  education. </p>
<p> Across the 6 Ontario sites<sup id="fn16-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn16"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>16</a></sup> analyzed, 63% of Pathways students from the  2010 and 2011 cohorts applied to a post-secondary institution. Application  rates were highest in Regent Park (75%) and lowest in Kitchener (51%). </p>
<p> Furthermore, the average  Pathways-eligible Regent Park student claimed more tuition spending as an  income tax deduction than the average Toronto Community Housing project student  who enrolled in a Toronto District School Board school between 2000 and 2008<sup id="fn17-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn17"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>17</a></sup>. </p>
</section>
<section>
<h4>Adapted programming in  Winnipeg positively affected Indigenous youth </h4>
<p>Focus group discussions with Pathways alumni in Winnipeg<sup id="fn18-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn18"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>18</a></sup>, of which 72% of Pathways students are  Indigenous, suggested that the program is positively influencing their lives. In  focus groups, the Winnipeg Pathways staff stated that some of the Indigenous  students faced multiple barriers and challenges and, as such, they adapted the  Pathways programming to meet these students' specific needs and circumstances.  For example, Pathways programming in Winnipeg has adapted to Indigenous culture  and offers a medicine wheel, sharing circles, smudging ceremonies and sweat  lodge ceremonies. Winnipeg Pathways staff supported the holistic development of  the students and created a space where students had a sense of belonging and  could build relationships<sup id="fn19-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn19"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>19</a></sup>. </p>
<p> In addition, other services that Pathways staff in Winnipeg provided for  students when necessary included collaborating with housing organizations to  provide beds for homeless students; established a peer helper initiative to  help students develop leadership skills and gain confidence; and, provide meals  and snacks for students who attend tutoring sessions. </p>
<p> Focus group participants in Winnipeg agreed that Pathways positively  helped them to do better in school and graduate from high school. Some  participants (43%) also noted that they were the first ones to graduate  in their family and highlighted the importance of having adult figures in their  lives that value education and motivate them to do well in school. The focus  group participants who had gone on to post-secondary education had accessed the  Pathways scholarship and indicated it had helped them purchase school-related  supplies and equipment (e.g., books, laptops, etc.)<sup id="fn20-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn20"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>20</a></sup>. </p>
<h3 id="h5.3">3.3 Impacts</h3>
<p><strong>Impacts are positive or negative, primary or secondary long-term effects  produced by the program, directly or indirectly, intended or unintended<sup id="fn21-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn21"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>21</a></sup></strong><strong>.</strong> </p>
<p> This section presents the impacts of  participation in Pathways. The findings demonstrate the extent to which the  program can be attributed to improving high school graduation rates; increasing the number of eligible students entering and  graduating from post-secondary education; and improving the labour market outcomes for Pathways-eligible students. </p>
</section>
<section>
<h4>Pathways positively affected  high school graduation rates</h4>
<p>Across observed Pathways sites, there  was a noticeable improvement in graduation rates compared to non-eligible  students<sup id="fn22-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn22"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>22</a></sup>. Graduation rates were 19.1%  higher for participants at the Ontario sites on average. The graduation rates  in the Halifax and Verdun sites were also higher for participants (28.4 percentage points and 10.4 percentage points, respectively)<sup id="fn23-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn23"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>23</a></sup>. </p>
<p> This finding is supported by a  separate study, conducted in 2017, which also attributed an increase in  graduation rates to participation in Pathways<sup id="fn24-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn24"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>24</a></sup>. It estimated that eligibility in  Pathways led to an increase of 35% in high school graduation rates for  Pathways-eligible Regent Park students compared to non-eligible students from  Toronto public housing projects. </p>
<p> Figure 4, below, also demonstrates how  Pathways positively influences secondary school completion. Across 10 sites  where Pathways was present in the 2015-16 academic year, there was a noticeable  increase in the share of students who graduated no more than 1 year beyond  the province's standard secondary school term (e.g., within 4 years where  high school comprises grades 10, 11, and 12) than was the case in the year  before Pathways was introduced<sup id="fn25-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn25"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>25</a></sup>. This type of comparison cannot  attribute the observed increases to Pathways, but the improvement does suggest  that the Program is likely contributing to greater on-time graduation at these  sites. </p>

<h4>Pathways had a positive  effect on enrollment to post-secondary education and educational attainment</h4>
<p>In addition to the improved graduation rates noted above, the average Pathways-eligible  Regent Park<sup id="fn26-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn26"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>26</a></sup> student claimed more post-secondary tuition  expenditures for university or college.  Figure 5 illustrates that between the ages of 19 and 23, the average  Pathways-eligible student had higher tuition expenditures than an average  non-eligible student indicating that more Pathways-eligible students  participated in a post-secondary education. As well, the regression estimates indicate  that eligibility for Pathways increases postsecondary education attainment by approximately  0.5 years.</p>

<p>In addition to the improved incidence of employment, the regression  analysis found that Pathways-eligible students made less use of social  assistance and employment insurance benefits than ineligible students, on  average. Specifically, they decreased their likelihood of receiving social  assistance by 5.1 percentage points and employment insurance by 5.8 percentage  points when compared to non-eligible students.

<h3 id="h5.4">3.4 Costs and benefits</h3>
<p>This section presents benefits and costs associated with participation  in the program that arise from improving high school completion rates and  increasing post-secondary participation. As the program is focused on early  interventions, the effects and benefits can be long-lasting and require a  longer time horizon to fully assess the impacts. </p>
<p> The costs and benefits of Pathways accumulate to both individual participants  and to governments over the short- and long-term (see Appendix B for further  details). The impacts of the program begin with participation in Pathways,  which results in students improving their high school completion rates. </p>
<p> Using Pathways-eligible Regent Park students as a proxy and comparing  them to similar student population without access to Pathways programming, participation  in Pathways increased the individual's lifetime earnings, even after factoring  in the additional costs associated with higher levels of education and  reductions in Employment Insurance and Social Assistance benefits received. </p>
<p> From the individual's perspective, there are short-term costs that arise  from participation, such as the direct costs of post-secondary education and  the opportunity costs of foregoing employment to increase educational  attainment, which can be offset by short-term benefits such as education  subsidies and improved skills/employability. </p>
<p> Long-term benefits for individuals consist of greater lifetime earnings  and improved social outcomes. Pathways helps at-risk youth graduate high  school, thus improving their skills and outcomes. Pathways participants are subsequently  less likely to rely on government supports and may pay more taxes as their  labour market attachment strengthens, which in turn may moderate (but does not  completely offset) their life-time improvement in earnings. </p>
<p> From the government's perspective, short-term costs consist of program  costs and costs associated with supporting higher levels of education. Benefits  to the government begin in the medium-term and extend into the long-term. These  benefits include increased tax revenues from greater lifetime earnings of  participants; decreased outlay on Employment Insurance, Social Assistance and  other labour market programming; and, a potential decrease in spending on  social programs, such as justice and health, reflecting the improved outcomes  of participants. Not all of these benefits—particularly those reflecting  improved social outcomes—are easily quantifiable. </p>
<p> Figure 8 illustrates the costs and benefits of Pathways associated to governments  and an individual student over a longer period of time. The incremental impacts  were determined by comparing the outcomes of Pathways-eligible students to non-eligible  students in Regent Park<sup id="fn31-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn31"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>31</a></sup>. This analysis was estimated by comparing costs and  benefits associated with individuals participating in Pathways compared to  individuals who did not participate. </p>

<p>While the Pathways' program has total  costs ($17,920) in the short-term<sup id="fn32-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn32"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>32</a></sup> from the government perspective (from all  sources of funding), the long-term approach reveals a net benefit ($2,010) due  to decreased outlays and increased revenues. </p>
<p> In the short-term, Pathways-eligible  students incur tuition costs related to post-secondary education and foregone  earnings due to decreased employment while attending school. Their benefits  include a tuition tax credit remitted to individuals attending a college or  university and greater net earnings from having pursued a post-secondary education. </p>
<p> The  individual's total net benefit is about $5,480. The total net social benefit to  society of an eligible student participating in Pathways over 25 years is  $7,490 compared to a non-eligible student. This results  in a social return on investment for Pathways of 50.1% over 25  years or a compound annual growth rate of 1.6%. </p>
<p> As a result, an investment in the  program “breaks even” (where the benefits equal the costs) after 22.5 years  from a government perspective and after 20.8 years from a total social net  benefit perspective. </p>
<p> As noted above, other potential gains,  such as improved well-being for individuals related to better health outcomes  and improved social outcomes (for example, reduced interactions with the  criminal justice system), may also accrue to individuals.  A number of studies suggest that completing  high school is linked to social and economic benefits later in life<sup id="fn33-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn33"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>33</a></sup>. </p>
<p> Though not quantifiable for the  purposes of this analysis, international studies have shown that secondary  school completion is correlated with: </p>
<ul>
<li>Large and significant decrease in the likelihood of both conviction and  incarceration</li>
<li>Small, but significant, improvements in health outcomes</li>
<li>Increased civic engagement with the probability of voting rising by 28  to 34 percentage points</li>

<h2 id="h6">4. Lessons  learned and conclusions</h2>
<section>
<h3 id="h6.1">4.1  Lessons learned</h3>
<p>Pathways is an organization that  assists Canadian youth living in poverty and who are at risk of dropping out of  high school. Pathways help youth graduate from high school and transition into  post-secondary education so they can reach their full potential. </p>
<p> The lessons learned— applicable to both Pathways and similar programming—are  as follows: </p>
<section>
<h4>Targeted early interventions  can positively affect vulnerable populations</h4>
<p>Targeted and sustained early  interventions for vulnerable youth has resulted in significant positive  outcomes. The evidence indicates that Pathways is improving high school  graduation rates. </p>
<ul>
<li>Graduation rates were higher for Pathways students compared to  non-eligible students at the Ontario, Verdun and Halifax sites </li>
</ul>
<p>Students where participation in  Pathways was an option invested more in post-secondary education than  comparable students not able to access the program. </p>
<ul>
<li>The average Regent Park Pathways-eligible student claimed more  post-secondary tuition expenditures for university or college than the  average non-eligible student </li>
</ul>
<p>Moreover, it positively affected their labour market outcomes. </p>
<ul>
<li>Employment earnings for Regent Park Pathways-eligible students at age 26  were $1,200 greater than the earnings of non-eligible students </li>
<li>Pathways positively affected the employment rate of young adults  eligible to participate in the program by 6 percentage points at age 26 </li>
<li>Regent Park Pathways-eligible students made less use of Social  Assistance and Employment Insurance benefits </li>
</ul>
</section>
<section>
<h4>A key component of the success of the Pathways  model is the flexibility to adapt to local needs and conditions</h4>
<p>The flexible nature of the Pathways  program allowed staff to adjust the programming to meet the unique needs of the  local youth. </p>
<p> For example, Pathways staff adapted the  programming at the Winnipeg site to address the multiple barriers and  challenges faced by Indigenous students by incorporating Indigenous teachings  and traditions. The findings from this example suggest that this tailored programming  has had a positive influence on the lives of Indigenous youth. </p>
</section>
<section>
<h4>Early interventions with  vulnerable populations can generate long-term net benefits not just for  individuals but also for governments </h4>
<p>Pathways participants and the  government both incurred short and long-term costs and benefits from  participation. Using the impact analysis for Pathways-eligible Regent Park students as  a proxy, it was determined that the  average total benefit for an eligible participant are greater than the personal  costs and result in a net benefit of $5,480 per individual. In addition, this  does not include any improvements in well-being that might arise from other  improved outcomes. </p>
<p> From a government perspective, participants may  be less likely to require government supports (i.e. Employment Insurance, Social  Assistance) over their lifetime and may contribute more to government revenues due  to improved personal incomes and stronger attachment to the labour market. The  same social cost-benefit analysis noted above determined the benefits to the government outweigh the costs  associated with Pathways resulting in a net benefit of $2,010 even before  potential gains due to reduced expenditures on other types of programs or  potential intergenerational effects. Considering only a limited set of  government programs (Employment Insurance and Social Assistance) and revenue  and expenditure sources, governments collectively break even 22.5 years after  the initial investment, after which point it represents a net gain. </p>
<p> When taken together, the total net  social benefit of participation was calculated at $7,490 per participant over a  25-year projection, for a total social rate of return of 50.1%.  Looking over a longer time horizon and including other factors would  potentially increase this even further. </p>
<h3 id="h6.2">4.2  Conclusion</h3>
<p>Overall, the findings show that  Pathways reduced the high school dropout rate and increased access to  post-secondary education. The program is flexible, adapting to the needs and  characteristics of the target population and benefits society as a whole. </p>
<p> As such, programming of this  nature—designed to support early interventions to help vulnerable youth  complete high school—has a valuable role to play. </p>

<ol>
<li>Participation in Pathways leads to  improved high school completion rates and increased post-secondary  participation.</li>
<li>The short-term costs include the direct  costs of schooling, opportunity costs of schooling for individuals. For  governments, the short-term costs include program costs and costs associated  with increased schooling (such as increased use of tax credits).</li>
<li>The individual short-term benefits are  education subsidies and improved skills/employability.</li>
<li>The governments' benefits are both  short-term and long-term.

</ol>
<p>This graphic presents a conceptual  framework for how costs and benefits might accrue from participation in the  Pathways to Education program. While not intended to be exhaustive, it includes  elements that are not part of the net benefit analysis due to insufficient  information on how to quantify the specific cost or benefit, such as the gains  from potential improvements to health outcomes, but are reasonably expected to  have an effect. </p>

</figure>
<p>This section presents the methodology  used to develop the analysis found in section 3.4 of the report and  provides more detail on Figure 8: Costs and Benefits per Student over 25  Years.</p>
<p> Programs that focus on improving the  outcomes of youth are designed, almost by definition, to have long-lasting and  cumulative effects. As such, analysis focused entirely around the period of  intervention will underestimate the full impact of the programs for individual  participants and for society in general. </p>
<p> The  benefits and costs associated with participation in Pathways stem from the  direct and indirect effects of the program's ability to improve high school  completion rates and, by extension, increase post-secondary participation.  These benefits do not accumulate solely to the individual participant, but  neither are the costs associated with participation borne only by the program  or its funding sources. As such, the many short-term and long-term labour  market outcomes, as well as social benefits, result in broader positive impacts  for society that are rarely captured in more limited, traditional cost-benefit  analysis. </p>
<div class="well">
<p><strong>Source material: “Long term impacts of the Pathways to  Education program” (2018)</strong></p>
<p> In “Long Term Impacts of the  Pathways to Education Program”, authors Lavecchia, Oreopolous and Brown used  a difference-in-differences method to determine the causal impacts of Pathways.  This report compared a sample of eligible high school students who entered  grade 9 between 2000 and 2005 in a location served by the Pathways program to a  statistically similar sample of students who were not eligible (non-eligible  students) for the program in 70 public housing projects in the City of Toronto.  The impacts from the analyses focused on the Regent Park site. </p>
<p> Outcomes presented in Lavecchia et al. (2018) are "implied"  (regression-adjusted) means for eligible and non-eligible students. Several  other factors (such as housing project and cohort fixed effects) are accounted  for in these means, allowing them to more precisely reflect the impact of  Pathways on individuals. Furthermore, the difference between the  regression-adjusted means for participants and non-participants can be  interpreted as the causal effect of the program under the assumption that the  evaluation of outcomes for participants would have followed the same path as  the outcomes for non-participants. The plausibility of this assumption is  tested in Lavecchia et al. (2018) through the process of establishing  treatment and control groups. </p>
<p> These results  for Regent Park are used as a proxy for the program overall. While any  individual site might have better or worse incremental impacts for their  observed populations, there is nothing to suggest that these results might be  an outlier. </p>
</div>
<p> Through impact analysis, the overall benefits  and costs of implementing the program per participant are presented in Figure  8: Costs and Benefits per Student over 25 Years in section 3.4 of the report.  These figures are based on calculations and assumptions (outlined below) made  by the Evaluation Directorate of ESDC. It is founded in the incremental impacts  reported by Lavecchia et al. (2018) for Pathways-eligible participants at the  Regent Park site in versus a control group (see explanatory box), which is  treated as a proxy for Program-wide participation results in this analysis. This  type of analysis supports the evaluation's effort to better assess and estimate  the relevance of the program and the efficiency and effectiveness of its  outcomes. </p>
<section>
<h3>Projections: Time  horizon and discount rate</h3>
<p>All estimates assume a 25-year time horizon  and an annual discount rate of 3%. </p>
<p> A discount rate of 3% is consistent  with the discounting done in Lavecchia et al. (2018)<sup id="fn34-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn34"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>34</a></sup> and other  similar studies that examine the impacts of education interventions on earnings  (Krueger, 1999; and Chetty et. al., 2011). This rate is also in line with  Boardman et al. (2008) and the interim TBS guide for Cost-Benefit Analysis (the  “TBS Guide”). The TBS Guide, which cites Boardman et al. (2008), suggests a  social discount rate of 3% accompanied by a shadow price of investment  applied to all the costs that crowd out investment activity<sup id="fn35-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn35"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>35</a></sup>. Since  Pathways does not invest in capital and is not a regulation, the 3% rate is applied without modification. </p>

<p>The components of the net benefit analysis  are discussed in the order that they appear in Figure 8 (from left to right) in  section 3.4 of the report. </p>
<p> Below are the costs and benefits from the  perspective of governments. All values include the Marginal Social Costs of  Public Funds, the distortionary loss incurred by society when raising  additional taxes to fund government spending. This effect increases the  magnitude of both the costs and benefits associated with a government program.  As a result, this effect will be positive (net benefit) if a program generates  net savings, but negative (net cost) if it falls short. As in previous  evaluations produced by Employment and Social Development Canada (see the 2017 Evaluation  of the Labour Market Development Agreements), the effect is assumed to be 20%, this is to say that each dollar of net costs or net benefits generated  by a program or an intervention is increased by 20 cents. </p>
<dl>
<dt>Program costs</dt>
<dd>
<p>This  is based on the total program costs per participant ($14,935) reported in  Lavecchia et al. (2018) and applies to Regent Park Pathways-eligible students. </p>
<p> Funding to cover these program costs includes not  only the direct contributions of the Government of Canada, but also  contributions from the Government of Ontario and private donations. </p>
<p> As these sources cannot be disentangled from the  final program costs, the Marginal Social Costs of Public Funds is applied to  the entire amount and may represent an overestimate as a result. The Marginal  Social Costs of Public Funds adds an additional $2,987 (20% of $14,935)  for a total cost of $17,920 per student. While this cost will be spread out  over multiple years, it is treated as an upfront expense and the amount is not  discounted. </p>
</dd>
<dt> Post-secondary tax credit </dt>
<dd>
<p> Tuition  expenses are reported in Lavecchia et al. (2018). This value is the difference  in annual average tuition tax credits between participants and non-participants  between the ages of 19 and 26. It represents a cost to governments due to the  increased take-up of post-secondary education. After discounting, this amounts  to $1,433. The Marginal Social Cost of Public Funds increases  this expense by 20% for a total cost of $1,719 for the analysis period. </p>
<p>Related, though not included, are the potential  additional institutional costs associated with a student continuing their  studies beyond secondary school. The incremental cost of an additional student  is likely minimal for the post-secondary educational system, but it is  conceivable that sufficient scaling of the program could increase system-wide  pressures due to increased demand.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Social assistance and employment insurance</dt>
<dd>
<p> Lavecchia  et al. (2018) reports a reduction in social assistance use among Pathways-eligible  students compared to non-eligible students of $525 in 2013. For this analysis,  this reduction is assumed to be constant over the entire analysis period. </p>
<p> Similarly, Lavecchia et al. (2018) reports that in  2013 a reduction in the use of Employment Insurance among Pathways-eligible  students compared to non-eligible students of $183. This is also assumed to be  constant over the entire analysis. </p>
<p> The total combined savings is $12,706 after  discounting. </p>
<p> These may be middling estimates, as benefit use may  change as a result of changes in an individual's income over time. Incremental  impacts related to Social Assistance, for example, may widen as incomes and  outcomes diverge. In the case of Employment Insurance, it is unclear if benefits  received by participants would increase or decrease relative to  non-participants over the 25-year period. On the one hand, participants appear  to have greater labour market attachment and may earn more, entitling them to  greater benefits during a job separation. On the other hand, participants may  experience fewer extended periods of unemployment, leading to less dependency  on Employment Insurance. </p>
<p> Because it is a net benefit to governments, the  Marginal Social Cost of Public Funds increases the size of this benefit by  20%. This results in a net benefit to governments of $15,248 over  the analysis period. </p>
</dd>
<dt>Increased government revenue</dt>
<dd>
<p> Using  forecasted earnings underlying the values for Net Post-Studies Earnings of  individuals (see below), the incremental taxes paid are estimated based on  similar incremental impacts observed for Ontario participants in Employment  Benefits and Support Measures delivered through the Canada-Ontario Labour  Market Development Agreement. For example, administrative data for tax years  2002 through 2012 showed that where there was an incremental impact on earnings  of just over $1000 in a year, it resulted in increased income taxes paid of  roughly $140 compared to the control population. This was calculated from the  age of 24 to 43, as between 19 and 23 the forecasted earnings for both  participants and non-participants were below or around the basic personal  amount. The total incremental amount for income taxes came to $3,807 after  discounting. </p>
<p> In addition to the gains from income taxes,  the analysis included estimates of the incremental impact in revenues due to  combined Federal and Provincial sales taxes. As in the 2017 Evaluation of the  Labour Market Development Agreements, it is assumed that each dollar in  incremental earnings results in 48 cents of spending on taxable goods (i.e., a  propensity to consume of 96% with an assumed breakdown of half on  taxable and half on non-taxable goods and services). With a Harmonized Sales  Tax (HST) rate of 13%, this results in a little over 6 cents of sales  tax for each incremental dollar in earnings. The total incremental amount for  sales taxes came to $1,526 after discounting. </p>
<p> Because it is a net benefit to governments,  the Marginal Social Cost of Public Funds increases the size of these benefits  by 20%. Combined, this results in $6,400 in benefits due to  increased tax revenues. </p>
<p> Changes in payroll taxes, such as Employment  Insurance Premiums, are not included in this estimation. </p>
<p> Below are the costs and benefits from the  perspective of the individual participant. Unlike the costs and benefits from  the governments' perspective, the costs and benefits experienced by the  individual participant are not affected by Marginal Social Costs of Public  Funding. As was the case above, specific values presented below are prior to  application of the discount rate. </p>
</dd>
<dt>Reduced wages during studies</dt>
<dd>
<p> Lavecchia et al. (2018) report average  annual earnings for eligible students and non-eligible students from ages 19 to  26. Pathways-eligible students have lower average annual earnings than non-eligible  students between the ages of 19 and 23. The difference in annual earnings  between these 2 groups between ages 19 and 23 is taken to be the estimated  opportunity cost of participating in the program and assumed to be associated  with increased likelihood participation in schooling. The total difference is  $3,022 after discounting. </p>
</dd>
<dt>Post-secondary tuition</dt>
<dd>
<p>Lavecchia  et al. (2018) provides average tuition costs incurred by program eligible  students between ages 19 and 26. Eligible students are more likely to pursue  post-secondary education, and incur greater tuition expenses. After  discounting, this amounts to $1,433 for the analysis period.</p>
<p>This value only reflects what has been reported and  claimed according to the tax records and may understate actual incremental  expenditures. Further amounts are not projected beyond the age of 26.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Social assistance and employment insurance</dt>
<dd>
<p> Lavecchia  et al. (2018) reports a reduction in 2013 of social assistance use among Pathways-eligible  students compared to similar students at sites where the Program is unavailable  of $525. This is assumed to be constant over the entire analysis period. </p>
<p> Similarly, Lavecchia et al. (2018) reports  a reduction in the use of Employment Insurance in 2013 among Pathways-eligible  students compared to similar students at sites where the Program is unavailable  of $183. This is assumed to be constant over the entire analysis period. </p>
<p> The total combined savings is $12,706 after  discounting. </p>
<p> From the individual participant's  perspective, changes in Social Assistance and Employment Insurance income are a  reduction in lifetime earnings and represent a cost. </p>
<p> It should be noted that this method treats a dollar  collected in Social Assistance or Employment Insurance as being of equal value  to a dollar earned from employment. A potential concern of this approach is  that it does not consider the possibility that income from employment earnings  may be preferred to income from Social Assistance and Employment Insurance, as  employment earnings may be a reflection of self-sufficiency, well-being, and greater  participation in society. </p>
</dd>
<dt>Net post-studies earnings</dt>
<dd>
<p> Lavecchia  et al. (2018) finds that from the age of 24 to 26 (inclusive), eligible  students have higher average annual earnings than non-eligible students. This  increases from $950 at age 24 to $1,207 at age 27. </p>
<p> Earnings for participants and the  divergence in earnings between the 2 group from age 27 ($1,369) to age 43 ($3,425)  are extrapolated from the above results. The forecasted earnings for  participants is the sum of these 2 extrapolated values. See Appendix C: Lifetime  Earnings Assumptions for the Net Social Cost-Benefit Analysis for more details. </p>
<p> The divergence in incomes does result in a  larger gain than assumed by Lavecchia et al. (2018), as the authors assume a  constant gap of $1,207 after age 27. </p>
<p> From the total increased post-studies earnings, the  additional amount paid in taxes (see Increased Government Revenues above) is  removed. The net increase in post-studies earnings is $22,144 after  discounting. </p>
<p> Taken together, the social rate of return  is calculated as the total net benefits of individuals and government ($2,010 +  $5,480 = $7,490) divided by the unadjusted program costs ($14,935), which  equals 50.1% over 25 years or an annualized rate of return of 1.6%. </p>
</dd>

<h3>Beyond year 25</h3>
<p>The 25-year time horizon was selected in  order to illustrate the effects of early interventions over a longer period.  Even at 25 years, the constrained time period likely underestimates the full  discounted benefits of a program such as Pathways. </p>
<p> The most obvious underestimation relates to  improved lifetime earnings. Pathways, by definition, involves an intervention  at a point very early in a person's life. As such, the expected earnings  differential should persist well beyond the 25-year time horizon (when the  participant will be only 43 years old) and may even continue to expand. This  would have implications not only for the individual—who would see net earnings  increase—but also on the Governments perspective, which could experience  further savings in Social Assistance and Employment Insurance and increased tax  revenues. </p>
<p> Also outside the time horizon, governments  may enjoy savings in seniors' programs—particularly Old Age Security/the  Guaranteed Income Supplement—because of the individual's greater lifetime  earnings. Expanding the analysis would require taking into account Canada  Pension Plan (CPP) payments and would need to analyze the effect related to the  collection of CPP premiums over the entire period (currently not included in  the analysis). </p>
<p> Finally, intergenerational effects could  play an important role in considering the long-term outcomes associated with  such an early intervention. This is beyond the scope of the evaluation, but  longer time horizons could reasonably wish to encompass the effects of improved  outcomes on successive generations. </p>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Further analysis:  other social benefits</h3>
<p>In addition to the related labour market costs  and benefits of governments and of individuals captured above, there are social  benefits of the program that would factor into a more extensive analysis of Pathway's  net benefit. </p>
<p> As an extension of the analysis to date, it  would be worthwhile to examine ways to reflect other societal gains—such as  savings for governments and higher well-being for individuals related to better  health outcomes and reduced criminality—that may correlate with the outcomes  observed. The Department may seek to consider how best to quantify these effects  for future analysis and longer time-series data may be required. Even if  quantified, however, it is unlikely this would capture the full positive  impact, as it would not reflect the knock-on effects within society. </p>

<h2 id="aC">Appendix C: lifetime earnings assumptions for the net social cost-benefit analysis</h2>
<p>Lavecchia et al. (2018) find that from the age of 24 to 26 (inclusive), eligible students have higher average annual earnings than non- eligible students. This earnings differential increases by 6% between 24 years old ($950) and 26 years old ($1,207). </p>
<p>In order to estimate the program’s incremental impact over 25 years, the Net Social-Cost Benefit Analysis requires an estimate of the earnings over the analysis period of participants and non-participants. This section of the report details the assumptions made in the Social Cost-Benefit Analysis to project earnings beyond 26 years old (labelled as the “Straight-Line Projection” approach) and also an alternative method undertaken as a robustness check (the “Educational Attainment” approach).</p>
<section>
<h3>Straight-line projection</h3>
<p>The following steps were taken to project earnings for both participants and non-participants from age 27 to 43 (inclusive):</p>
<ol class="lst-spcd">
<li>Extrapolated income levels for non-participants from age 27 to 43 using a straight trend line</li>
<li>Used the difference in average annual earnings (for each year between 24 and 26) reported in Lavecchia et al. (2018) to extrapolate the future increases using a straight trend line</li>
<li>The forecasted earnings for participants is the sum of these 2 extrapolated values</li>
</ol>
<p>The annual post-program earnings of participants show incremental gains over the years to follow. The size of the increase continuously grew over the years and ranged from $1,369 (age 27) to $3,425 (age 43). In other words, at the end of the projection period the annual average earnings of participants were $3,425 higher than if they had not participated. </p>
<p>The upward growth in income is consistent with what is observe in Statistics Canada data, where average earnings appear to peak after 50 years old for all levels of educational attainment. However, this assumption of a sustained, steady rise results in a more gradual increase in the initial years than is generally observed in the data (where a sharper increase will generally occur between the 20 to 24 and the 25 to 29 age categories).</p>

<p>In order to estimate the program's incremental impact over  25 years, the net social-cost benefit analysis requires an estimate of  the earnings over the analysis period of participants and non-participants.  Figure 9 depicts the projected earnings beyond 26 years old, i.e. earnings for  both participants and non-participants from age 27 to 43 (inclusive), labelled  as the “Incremental Impact” approach. In addition, as an alternative method was  undertaken as a robustness check, labelled as the “Income levels” approach. </p>

<h3>Robustness check:  Educational attainment approach</h3>
<p>Given the simplicity of the Straight-Line Projection  method, the Evaluation Directorate wished to validate it against a method using  assumptions on educational attainment and age. This was to ensure that the  Straight-Line Projection:</p>
<ul>
<li>provided  a good approximation of the pattern that might be observed under other assumptions. </li>
<li>would  not result in significant over-estimates in the potential gains in lifetime  earnings over the analysis period. </li>
</ul>
<p>To that end, the Evaluation Directorate  used Statistics' Canada income/earnings data (2010) in order to construct the  average income profile for participants and non-participants based on the average income associated with age and educational attainment,  as in Table C1.</p>

<p>In order to determine the weights/breakdown  among different educational attainment categories, the Report on Pathways to  Education produced by Goss Gilroy Inc (GGI report) was used to weight “no  certificate, diploma or degree” versus those that completed secondary school or  higher. As per the GGI report, 57.6% of participants and 38.5% of  the comparison group completed high school.</p>
<p>Among those that graduated high school,  distributions observed among Ontario residents aged 25 to 64 as reported in the  2016 Census was applied. The Ontario data were used to remain consistent with  the Toronto-area population analyzed by Lavecchia et al (2018). These can be  found in Table C2.</p>

<summary>Figure 10: Incremental impacts (participant earnings minus non-participant earnings) of the straight-line projection approach versus the educational attainment approach – Text version</summary>
<p>The graph depicts the incremental impacts, i.e. the participant  earnings minus non-participant earnings, of the straight-line projection  approach, in comparison with those of the educational attainment approach. The  Straight-Line Projection approach produces a conservative estimate over the  projection period and is derived from the initial observed data. As well, it  follows a similar growth path in incremental impacts, and it requires fewer  assumptions that need to be calibrated to the target population.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The Evaluation Directorate favoured the continued use of the Straight-Line  Projection approach given that it: produces a more conservative estimate over  the projection period; is derived from the initial observed data; follows a  similar growth path in incremental impacts; and requires fewer assumptions that  need to be calibrated to the target population. </p>
<p> Should the projection period be extended further, however, a  re-evaluation of the income assumptions would be necessary and would likely  require the introduction of more complex assumptions. </p>
