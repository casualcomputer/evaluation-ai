<h2 id="0.1">Executive Summary</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>This report  presents the findings of the evaluation of Natural Resources Canada’s (NRCan’s)  Mining Innovation sub-program. This sub-program is managed by CanmetMINING, a  federal government science and technology (S&amp;T) laboratory under the  oversight of NRCan’s Lands and Minerals Sector (LMS). The evaluation covers  approximately $26.7 million in NRCan expenditures over the five-year period of  2010-11 to 2014-15.</p>
<p>The purpose of the  evaluation is to assess the relevance and performance (i.e., effectiveness,  efficiency and economy) of the Mining Innovation sub-program using a mix of  qualitative and quantitative methods, including reviews of program files,  documents, literature, interviews and case studies. </p>
<h3>Sub-program  Overview</h3>
<p>The objective of  the Mining Innovation sub-program is to contribute to the innovation and global  competitiveness of the Canadian mining industry by improving its productivity  through the adoption of innovative techniques and technology. In particular,  the sub-program aims to support innovation in the mining industry by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Researching and  developing new mining-related tools, technology, methods, and protocols;</li>
<li>Disseminating  knowledge and research to stakeholders (including regulations);</li>
<li>Conducting pilot  tests related to new mining-related processes;</li>
<li>Collaborating with  provinces and territories, standard bodies (e.g., on regulations), and other  stakeholders;</li>
<li>Promoting the need  to be innovative in mining processes to industry stakeholders; and</li>
<li>Providing  specialized services to clients (e.g., testing, analyzing samples, validating  systems, and certifications).</li>
</ul>
<p>Activities carried  out by the sub-program are delivered in four project areas: (1) Mining  Extraction Innovation; (2) Mineral and Metallurgical Processing; (3) Canadian  Certified Reference Materials Project (CCRMP); and (4) Proficiency Testing  Program for Mineral Analysis Laboratories (PTP-MAL).</p>
<h3>Evaluation  Findings: Relevance </h3>
<p>The evaluation  identified an ongoing need for: support and collaborative approaches for  R&amp;D; delivery of specialized services (i.e., conformity assessment  services, laboratory proficiency testing); and coordination of mining  innovation efforts at the national-level. The Mining Innovation sub-program  aligns with federal government priorities and NRCan’s strategic outcomes, as  well as with federal roles and responsibilities, including NRCan’s mandate. The  large number of stakeholders and organizations involved in mining innovation  has led to some confusion among stakeholders as to the role of the sub-program  in the area of innovation in mining.</p>
<h3>Evaluation  Findings: Performance (Efficiency and Economy)</h3>
<p>The Mining  Innovation sub-program employs practices that facilitate the efficient and  economic production of outputs and contribution to intended outcomes. A key strength  is its collaboration with multiple stakeholders, which helps reduce the risk of  duplication of effort, facilitates the sharing of expertise, and helps the  sub-program identify the needs of the mining industry related to innovation. At  the time of the evaluation, CanmetMINING also maintained multiple  accreditations, which increase its reliability and enable it to deliver  specialized services (i.e., CCRMP and PTP-MAL). These accreditations also  ensure a level of consistency in project management.</p>
<p>A number of  stakeholders suggested the sub-program could build on its foundation of  collaboration and expertise to strengthen its leadership role by, developing a  national strategy on mining innovation to better focus innovation R&amp;D in  the mining sector. In addition, while the use of VNR affords the flexibility to  respond to client demand for services, there is an opportunity for the  sub-program to work towards stabilizing its funding to better position itself  to achieve sub-program outcomes. In particular, sub-program planning is sometimes  done at the project-level based on client needs or requests rather than at a  more strategic-level that would address broader policy objectives.</p>
<p>Similarly, performance  measurement was generally done at the level of individual projects and  according to the ISO 9001 project guide methodology, rather than for the  sub-program as a whole. This presents a potential challenge to the sub-program  to ensure it is delivered effectively, efficiently, and economically. </p>
<h3>Evaluation Findings: Performance (Effectiveness)</h3>
<p>The sub-program is making progress towards achieving its four intended  immediate outcomes: (1) reduced risks associated with adopting new techniques  and technologies; (2) increased access to relevant markets for industry  stakeholders; (3) increased awareness and understanding of innovative  technologies by industry stakeholders; and (4) increased understanding of  industry’s needs, priorities, concerns, and requirements. </p>
<p>It was also possible to align project-level information with the two  intended intermediate outcomes: (1) adoption of mining innovation (techniques,  technologies, etc.) by industry stakeholders; and (2) improved productivity  (including health and safety components) of the industry. Internal and external  stakeholders, however, raised the concern that it may be beyond the reach of  the sub-program to influence industry productivity.</p>
<p>In addition, the evaluation identified some factors that could  positively or negatively impact the ability of the sub-program to achieve its  intended outcomes, including: changing commodity prices, which could impact the  ability or willingness of stakeholders to invest in new or innovative  techniques or related R&amp;D; practices of other countries (e.g., tendency  towards protectionism in China and India) or investments in other sectors  (e.g., investment in innovation in the Canadian Mining industry is lower than  other sectors such as forestry, automotive, and manufacturing); financial  (e.g., return on investment), and non-financial (e.g., organizational culture  change) risks that industry may be unwilling to assume; potential constraints  associated with non-disclosure/intellectual property (IP) agreements; and level  of collaboration among stakeholders, which is important to facilitate outcome  achievement.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendations  and Management Response: </strong>Based on the findings and conclusions of the  evaluation, three recommendations are made to the Assistant Deputy Minister of  LMS. A management response and an action plan to all three recommendations have  been formulated.</p>

<h2 id="1.0">1.0	Introduction and Background</h2>
<h3 id="1.1">1.1	Overview</h3>
<p>This report presents the findings of the evaluation of Natural Resources Canada’s (NRCan’s) Mining Innovation sub-program. This sub-program is managed by CanmetMINING, a federal government science and technology (S&amp;T) laboratory under the oversight of NRCan’s Lands and Minerals Sector (LMS). The evaluation covers approximately $26.7 million in NRCan expenditures over the five-year period of 2010-11 to 2014-15.</p>
<p>The purpose of the evaluation is to assess the relevance and performance (i.e., effectiveness, efficiency and economy) of the Mining Innovation sub-program, as required by the Treasury Board of Canada’s Policy on Evaluation (2009) which was rescinded and replaced with the 2016 Policy on Results. Evaluation planning and data collection occurred between April 2015 and April 2016.</p>
<h3 id="1.2">1.2	Background</h3>
<p>Canada’s geology is rich in economically viable minerals and metals deposits, which makes Canada one of the largest mining nations in the world (Mining Association of Canada. Mining facts). According to these mining facts, more than 60 minerals and metals are produced across the country, and 1,289 companies are involved in the extraction of minerals, with forecasted investments of $160 billion in the Canadian mining industry over the next 10 years. In terms of share of global production, Canada is first in potash; second in uranium, nickel and niobium; third in cobalt, aluminum and platinum group metals; fourth in salt, sulphur and tungsten; and fifth in diamonds, graphite and gold.</p>
<p>Canadian mining sector competitiveness is built on a strong investment climate and solid regulatory structures for mining activities. Because mining activity in Canada is primarily under the jurisdiction of provinces and territories, the Canadian mining industry is “governed by dozens of federal, provincial and territorial acts and regulations...” (Mining Association of Canada. Regulatory effectiveness). In addition to the provincial and territorial acts and regulations, there are a number of federal acts and regulations that must be adhered to, including the: Canadian Environmental Protection Act; Fisheries Act; Navigable Waters Protection Act/Navigation Protection Act; Species at Risk Act; Migratory Birds Convention Act; and Transportation of Dangerous Goods Act.</p>
<h3 id="1.3">1.3	Sub-program Description</h3>
<p>As  noted above, CanmetMINING manages the Mining Innovation sub-program.  CanmetMINING is a federal government research laboratory that provides research  and scientific advice to the mining and minerals industries in collaboration  with provincial and territorial governments and other federal government  departments involved in promoting or regulating these industries. It has  facilities in Ottawa, Val-d’Or, and Sudbury, where it conducts research and  development (R&amp;D) on a variety of “processes and technologies involved in  extracting ore from the ground and transforming it into a concentrate, mineral  product or metal”. It also has a satellite office in Smithers.</p>
<p>The  objective of the Mining Innovation sub-program is to contribute to the  innovation and global competitiveness of the Canadian mining industry by  improving its productivity through the adoption of innovative techniques and  technology. In particular, the sub-program aims to support innovation in the  mining industry by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Researching and developing new mining-related tools, technology,  methods, and protocols;</li>
<li>Disseminating knowledge and research to stakeholders (including  regulations);</li>
<li>Conducting pilot tests related to new mining-related processes;</li>
<li>Collaborating with provinces and territories, standard bodies (e.g., on  regulations), and other stakeholders;</li>
<li>Promoting the need to be innovative in mining processes to industry  stakeholders; and</li>
<li>Providing specialized services to clients (e.g., testing, analyzing  samples, validating systems, and certifications).</li>
</ul>
<p>Per the logic model (presented in Annex A), these activities are  intended to produce the following outputs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Validated approaches, patents, and licences;</li>
<li>New scientific knowledge, new technologies, and new processes;</li>
<li>Scientific publications, demonstration projects, and information  products;</li>
<li>Pilot projects; and</li>
<li>Regulatory scientific input, stakeholder engagement mechanisms (e.g.,  consultation), and communication products.</li>
</ul>
<p>These activities and outputs, in turn, are expected  to result in the following immediate, intermediate, and ultimate outcomes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Immediate Outcomes:</li>
<ul>
<li>Reduced risks associated with adopting  new techniques and technologies;</li>
<li>Increased access to relevant markets for industry stakeholders;</li>
<li>Increased awareness and understanding of innovative technologies by  industry stakeholders; and</li>
<li>Increased understanding of industry’s needs, priorities, concerns, and  requirements.</li>
</ul>
<li>Intermediate Outcomes:</li>
<ul>
<li>Adoption of mining innovation (techniques, technologies, etc.) by  industry stakeholders; and</li>
<li>Improved productivity (including health and safety components) of the  mining industry.</li>
</ul>
<li>Ultimate Outcome:</li>
<ul>
<li>An innovative and globally-competitive Canadian mining industry.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>To deliver on these outcomes, the Mining Innovation  sub-program is delivered through four components:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Mining Extraction Innovation</strong>, which focuses on reducing the risk of  adopting new extraction technologies and processes, as well as developing new  products, particularly related to deep mining.</li>
<li><strong>Mineral and Metallurgical Processing</strong>, which  facilitates research on critical metals, rare earth elements (REE) and chromite  processing. Although Canada has exploitable deposits of critical metal, REE and  chromite, it has no current production.</li>
<li><strong>Canadian Certified Reference Materials Project (CCRMP)</strong>, which prepares and certifies reference materials for analytical  laboratories in the mineral, metallurgical, earth science and environmental  industries.</li>
<li><strong>Proficiency Testing Program for Mineral Analysis Laboratories (PTP-MAL)</strong>, which defines the metals of interest and concentration range of each, and  also establishes the criteria and target values for assessing laboratory  proficiency.</li>
</ol>
<p>According to its 2013/14 to 2016/17 <em>Integrated Business Plan</em> (IBP),  CanmetMINING’s approach to innovation is built on multi-stakeholder R&amp;D  projects to leverage resources and expertise. To that end, Innovation,  Science and Economic Development Canada recognises that CanmetMINING often conducts its research “in  partnership with industry, provincial governments, other federal departments,  universities, and international agencies”.</p>
<h3 id="1.4">1.4	Sub-program Resources</h3>
<p>Mining Innovation sub-program activities, through CanmetMINING, are undertaken using in-house and contracted research. Contracted research could involve sharing costs or tasks between CanmetMINING and a partner organization (e.g., industry, provinces, other federal departments, universities, etc.), or cost-recovery whereby CanmetMINING completes the work (e.g., CCRMP and PTP-MAL) and recovers the cost for this from the client. Table 1 identifies expenditures for the sub-program from 2010-11 through 2014-15.</p>

<h3 id="2.1">2.1	Evaluation Scope and Objectives</h3>
<p>The evaluation of the Mining Innovation sub-program assesses the sub-program’s  relevance in terms of addressing a demonstrable need, aligning with federal  government roles and responsibilities, and aligning with federal priorities and  departmental strategic objectives. It also assesses the sub-program’s performance  in terms of its effectiveness, efficiency and economy.</p>
<p>The scope of the evaluation was calibrated to reflect the fact that the  Green Mining Initiative (GMI), a closely related NRCan sub-program, had been  evaluated in 2015. The GMI targets the development of innovative energy efficient  technologies to improve the mining sector’s environmental performance, to  promote innovation in mining and to position Canada’s mining sector as the  global leader in green mining technologies and practices. Both sub-programs share a management  structure, including NRCan management, committees, and industry partners. As  such, the evaluation examined the efficiency of this structure. Furthermore,  the scope does not include an assessment of the ultimate outcome (an innovative  and globally-competitive Canadian mining industry) given the long-term nature  of the outcome and limited expectation of observing measurable progress that  could be attributable to the sub-program.</p>
<p>This evaluation considered the following eight evaluation questions:</p>
<p><strong>Relevance:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Is there an ongoing and continued need  for this sub-program?</li>
<li>To what extent do the priorities of the  sub-program align with federal government priorities and NRCan strategic  objectives?</li>
<li>Is there a legitimate and appropriate  role for the federal government to play with respect to mining innovation?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Performance (effectiveness):</strong></p>
<ol start="4">
<li>To what extent have the intended  outcomes of the sub-program been achieved?</li>
<li>To what extent have there been any  unintended impacts (positive or negative)?</li>
<li>What internal and external factors  impact the achievement of the intended outcomes?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Performance (efficiency and economy):</strong></p>
<ol start="7">
<li>Is the sub-program the most efficient  means of achieving the intended outputs and outcomes?</li>
<li>Is the sub-program the most economic  means of achieving the intended outcomes?</li>
</ol>
<p>The findings for each evaluation question are  presented in Sections 3 and 4. For each question, a rating and summary of the  supporting evidence are provided. The rating statements outlined in Table 3  assisted in ensuring consistency in reporting and facilitating the  interpretation of qualitative data.</p>

<h3 id="2.2">2.2	Evaluation Methods</h3>
<p>This evaluation used multiple lines of evidence to  assess the evaluation issues, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>File review</strong>: Of a total of approximately 185 project files, 56 were reviewed across  the sub-program (The 56 projects reviewed included: 33 from Mining Extraction  Innovation; 9 from Mineral and Metallurgical Processing; 13 from CCRMP; and 1  from PTP-MAL ). Files were selected using two criteria based on the findings of a  preliminary file review of approximately 10 project files: (1) representation  from each project area; and (2) availability of complete files consistent with  the quality assurance requirements of CanmetMINING’s internal filing system. To meet the  quality assurance requirements, each project was expected to contain the  following: completed and signed mandatory document (Mandoc) form; project  proposal; project prospectus; project plan and costing; project  agreements/Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs); invoices (if external); project  amendments; progress reports; annual reports; and post mortem reports.</li>
<li><strong>Document review</strong>: Approximately 50 documents were reviewed, including: key program  documentation; NRCan strategic documents (e.g., Reports on Plans and Priorities,  business plans), and Government of Canada strategic documents (e.g., Budgets,  Speeches from the Throne). The document review provided general information on  the relevance and performance of the sub-program.</li>
<li><strong>International and scientific literature  review</strong>: This was undertaken to position NRCan’s Mining  Innovation sub-program relative to achievements of others in similar areas, in  particular to respond to evaluation questions related to relevance and  efficiency and economy. The focus of this review was on the United States,  Australia, Europe, South Africa, China, international private laboratories and  research organizations, and domestic stakeholders (provinces and territories,  research consortiums, academia, mining associations and networks, etc.). While  literature was found on websites of those governments and organizations,  additional literature was provided by program representatives and stakeholders  during or following interview sessions given their involvement in the area of mining  innovation. </li>
<li><strong>Stakeholder interviews</strong>: Stakeholder  interviews were used to gather in-depth insights from individuals who are most  expert in delivery of the program. A list of stakeholders was identified  with the help of the program staff and project files review. A total of 24  interviews were conducted with 15 internal stakeholders (i.e., senior  management and staff) and nine external stakeholders (i.e., two other government  departments, three provinces and territories, and four representatives from the  mining industry). </li>
<li><strong>Case studies</strong>: In collaboration with program staff, the evaluation team selected nine  projects for detailed examination to provide illustrative examples of various  aspects of sub-program delivery and effectiveness. These were selected to  reflect the different areas of research, types of partner organizations,  project delivery dates, as well as funding and resource levels, and suitability  to inform the evaluation. The case studies were conducted using 15 interviews (nine  with project proponents and four with NRCan project managers) and document  review. Projects selected for case studies were:</li>
<ul>
<li>Mining Extraction Innovation (6):</li>
<ul>
<li>Analysis of Ground Support Materials and Properties for Xstrata Ni-Rim;</li>
<li>Evaluation of the behaviour of Swellex;</li>

<li>Développement  d’un système de surveillance en continu des câbles de hissage miniers;</li>
<li>Développement de cables synthétiques; and </li>
<li>Underground Coal Mining Safety Research Collaboration.</li>
</ul>
<li>Mineral Processing (2):</li>
<ul>
<li>Collaborative research on recovery of Neodymium, Yttrium, Dysprosium,  Praseodymium and Niobium from the Montviel ore; and</li>
<li>Behaviour of chromium during chromite ore processing applicable to  exploitation of ring of fire chromite deposits.</li>

<h3 id="2.3">2.3	Evaluation Limitations and Mitigation Strategies</h3>
<p>As outlined in Table 4, there were some limitations associated with the data collection faced in this evaluation. Table 4 also identifies the mitigation strategies used to address limitations.</p>

<td><p>The    program is fully compliant with ISO 9001:2008, for which audits are conducted    regularly. This standard requires organizations to have in place a quality    management system for all processes, including a quality assurance process    for all projects requiring them to contain standard materials (e.g.,    completed and signed mandatory document; project proposal, prospectus, plan,    and costing; agreements/ memoranda of understanding; etc.). Nevertheless, for    the purposes of the assessment of relevance and performance (i.e.,    effectiveness, efficiency and economy), there were sometimes inconsistent    reporting and documentation practices across projects (e.g., a mix of hard    and soft copy files, lack of reporting against outputs). As a result, not all    files could be reviewed.</p></td>
<td><p>A    sample of files was selected from each of the project areas where files were    deemed to be complete based on the quality assurance requirements of the    CanmetMINING internal filing system.

<tr>
<td><p><strong>Summary:</strong><br/>
      The evaluation identified a variety of ongoing needs    related to increasing innovation in the mining industry, including: support and    collaborative approaches for R&amp;D; specialized services such as conformity    assessment services and laboratory proficiency testing for accreditation; and    national coordination related to mining innovation.</p></td>

</table>
<h4>Support  and Collaborative Approaches for R&amp;D </h4>
<p>As of  2014, global REE production and the associated S&amp;T expertise were located  almost exclusively in China, which also dominated the production and export of  products containing REE. However, because resources in China are diminishing,  with less than 30 years worth of estimated supply remaining, China has been  implementing restrictions on its REE exports (since 2005), which has resulted  in significant price increases for REE on multiple occasions. The Standing  Committee on Natural Resources learned in 2014 “that Canada has significant  rare earth resource potential, and that developing REE is essential to the  Canadian economy and global competitiveness (<em>Standing</em> Committee on  Natural Resources, June 2014). To take advantage of this, however, public and private expertise is  necessary to pool the limited REE knowledge in Canada.</p>
<p>To that end, consultations led by CanmetMINING in 2012, with both  Canadian and international stakeholders, revealed a need for a coordinated  approach to deliver and advance REE-specific R&amp;D in Canada. Workshops led  by the Mining Innovation sub-program identified gaps related to REE and  chromite, which became the impetus for CanmetMINING establishing the Canadian  Rare Earth Elements Network (CREEN) “ to  collaborate, coordinate and optimize REE research in Canada and link to  international efforts”.(CanmetMINING. <em>Integrated  business plan, 2013). </em> CREEN is an industry-led network  consisting of industry, academia, consultants, and government, with a vision is  for Canada to establish REE production and economic growth. </p>
<p>In 2015, NRCan included a REE and chromite initiative as part of its Mining  Innovation sub-program focused specifically on addressing industry R&amp;D gaps  in this area, which was funded for approximately $25 million over five years,  starting in 2015-16.  In addition, NRCan  allocated approximately $2 million to the REE and chromite initiative from  existing reference levels. This focus on REE is consistent with evidence from the documentation  that identifies a need for collaborative R&amp;D to help overcome barriers  faced by this emerging sector, including from 2014, when the Standing Committee  on Natural Resources noted that in order to diversify the global supply of REE,  Canada needs to be involved (Standing Committee on Natural Resources, June 2014) All interviewees (internal and  external) identified the importance of maintaining the federal government contribution  to innovation by supporting a sustainable and secure supply of REE because the  Canadian mining industry is facing challenges and international competition.</p>
<p>Senior management from the sub-program also indicated that industry is  looking for low cost options for ore extraction and technologies that will  increase productivity and lower operating costs (e.g., technologies that will  increase energy efficiency, as energy is a significant cost in mining). The  document review corroborated this need, identifying a specific need for R&amp;D  to develop measures to overcome challenges faced by the mining industry in  relation to: discovering new deposits; operating deeper mines; increasing  energy costs; and navigating complex regulatory requirements. In 2015, the Mining  Association of Canada (MAC) identified trends showing three consecutive years  (ending in 2015) in which Canada’s share of international exploration  investment had fallen, suggesting competition for global mineral investment and  financing challenges faced by ‘junior’ companies. </p>
<h4>Conformity Assessment Services and Laboratory Proficiency Testing</h4>
<p>Evidence from the evaluation suggests that NRCan laboratories are  currently the only laboratories in Canada to offer many of the conformity  assessment services sought by industry. Literature suggests this is different  than the way these services are delivered in other countries, such as New  Zealand, Australia, and Switzerland where these services are delivered by the  private sector, or South Africa, where delivery of these services is shared  between public and private organizations – without this service being offered  elsewhere. Even though the relative benefits of private versus public delivery of  conformity assessment services was not explored as part of this evaluation, it  was found that in  Canada, this services are not being offered elsewhere and so there is a need  for NRCan laboratories to continue providing it. External interviewees, in  particular, believed these services target innovative aspects of the Canadian  mining industry. They also recognized the value of the impartial conformity  assessment services and laboratory proficiency assessment provided by  CanmetMINING as well as their potential contribution to enabling innovation in  the mining industry.</p>
<p>Related to the conformity assessment services, the sub-program, through  the PTP-MAL project area works with the Task Group Laboratories Minerals  Analysis Laboratories Working Group of the Standards Council of Canada (SCC) to  define “the metals of interest and the concentration range for each, as well as  establishing the criteria and target values for assessing laboratory  proficiency” (Natural  Resources Canada website, <em>Proficiency  Testing Program</em> ). In particular, on the NRCan website, it is  stated that “PTP-MAL is a means by which a mineral analysis laboratory can  assess its performance for one or more analytical methods independently of  internal quality control”. It is also stated that if a laboratory wants to be  accredited, or wants to maintain its accreditation, by the SCC to the International  Organization for Standardization (ISO)/International Electrotechnical  Commission (IEC) standard of ISO/IEC 17025 (i.e., General requirements for the  competence of calibration and testing laboratories), participation in the  PTP-MAL accreditation program is required. </p>
<h4>National Coordination Related to Mining Innovation</h4>
<p>Some external stakeholders identified that there seems to be a lack of a  clear definition of CanmetMINING’s role in coordinating mining innovation relative  to the role of others. Although CanmetMINING interviewees indicated that the  many players involved in mining innovation are complementing each other, all  external interviewees noted that the absence of an overarching collaborative  national strategy on mining innovation seems to affect the selection of  relevant mining projects that are recognized by all stakeholders. Many external  interviewees suggested CanmetMINING could strengthen its leadership role and  support the federal government in establishing an innovation strategy at the  national level, where the role of each party would be identified.</p>
<h3 id="3.2">3.2	Alignment with Federal Government Priorities and NRCan Strategic Objectives – Demonstrated</h3>
<table class="table table-bordered">
<tr>
<td><p><strong>Summary:</strong><br/>
      The Mining Innovation sub-program aligns with federal government priorities as identified in federal Budgets, as well as the Government of Canada’s S&amp;T strategy. The sub-program also aligns with NRCan’s strategic outcome, Canada’s Natural Resources Sectors are Globally Competitive, and the Department’s S&amp;T strategy.</p></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>According to the documents reviewed, the Mining Innovation sub-program  is consistent with federal government priorities, as indicated in federal  Budgets from 2014 to 2016. In the 2015 Budget, for instance, REE and chromite  specific properties were highlighted as critical inputs to the defence,  aerospace, automotive, energy and consumer electronic industries. Specifically,  the <em>Unlocking Rare Earth Elements and  Chromite</em> initiative announced in this Budget allocated $23 million over  five years, starting in 2015-16, to address the technical challenges of  separating and processing REE for use in advanced manufacturing applications  and products.</p>
<p>Mining Innovation is a sub-program in  NRCan’s 2014-15 Program Alignment Architecture (PAA), under Program 1.2,  Innovation for New Products and Processes, which supports Strategic Outcome 1,  Canada’s Natural Resources Sectors are Globally Competitive. To support this strategic  outcome, the following related expected results were identified for the program  and sub-program:</p>
<ul>
<li>Innovation for New Products and Processes Program: Natural resource  sectors increase production of new products and processes; and</li>
<li>Mining Innovation sub-program: Technology developers increase  demonstration of innovative mining and processing technologies (Natural  Resources Canada’s <em>2014-15 Report on  Plans and Priorities)</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The evaluation also found that the sub-program  aligns with NRCan’s <em>Science and  Technology Strategy: Creating a Sustainable Canadian Resource Advantage Through  Science and Technology</em> (2010). As noted in this strategy, NRCan’s S&amp;T  “serves the public interest through the generation of reliable, credible  knowledge that advances science and fosters innovation, informs public decision  making and delivers tangible benefits to Canadians”. This departmental S&amp;T strategy  supports the broader Government of Canada S&amp;T strategy: <em>Mobilizing Science and Technology to  Canada’s Advantage </em>(2007).</p>
<h3 id="3.3">3.3	Legitimacy and Appropriateness of Federal Role – Demonstrated</h3>
<table class="table table-bordered">
<tr>
<td><p><strong>Summary:</strong><br/>
      The Mining Innovation sub-program aligns with federal roles and responsibilities, in particular with the mandate of NRCan as specified in the Department of Natural Resources Act (1994). For the most part, NRCan involvement is considered by internal and external stakeholders to be appropriate, and important to improving scientific and technological capacity of the Canadian mining industry, including assisting the industry as a whole to address needs pertaining to innovation in the sector. In particular, CanmetMINING’s provision of specific services – conformity assessment services and laboratory proficiency assessments – were identified as providing confidence to the public through reliable and certified analytical information.<br/><br/>
However, the evaluation identified that there are many stakeholders and organizations involved in mining innovation, which leads to some confusion among internal and external stakeholders of the distinct role of the Mining Innovation sub-program in the area of innovation in mining.
</p></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Documents review and NRCan staff interviewees indicated that the Mining  Innovation sub-program aligns with NRCan’s mandate, as defined under section 6  of the <em>Department of Natural Resources  Act </em>(1994, c.41). For example, CCRMP activities help the department fulfill  its mandate as outlined in section 6(d), that the Minister shall “participate  in the development and application of codes and standards for technical surveys  and natural resource products and for the management and use of natural  resources”.</p>
<p>Senior management interviewees noted that there is a federal role to  play in enabling innovation and competitiveness for companies operating in  Canada so Canadians can benefit from increased productivity and employment in  mining. In this regard, CanmetMINING, including through the Mining Innovation sub-program,  has historically played a coordination role of R&amp;D activities in the  minerals and metals sector and provided specialized services to the mining  industry.</p>
<p>As part of the evaluation, all interviewees acknowledged this historical  role. They also recognized the potential for the expertise within CanmetMINING to  improve scientific and technological capacity of the mining industry in order to  assist the industry as a whole to address needs pertaining to innovation in the  sector. However, questions arose during the evaluation as to the precise role  NRCan plays in developing innovative mining practices given the number of  players involved.</p>
<p>As noted above, the Mining Innovation sub-program delivers specialized  services such as conformity assessment services and laboratory proficiency  assessments. The literature review identified that in other countries  government does not always provide these services (i.e., in some cases,  services were delivered by the private sector; in others it was a joint  responsibility between public and private sectors). Although the evaluation did  not explore the relative benefits of the private versus public delivery model  for these services, without these services being delivered elsewhere there is a  need for NRCan laboratories to continue providing these services. A memorandum  of understanding between the SCC and CanmetMINING assigning the role for these  services to CanmetMINING, provides an objective assessment “to ensure mineral  analysis testing laboratories meet minimum quality and reliability standards to  ensure a demonstrated uniform level of proficiency among these mineral analysis  testing laboratories” (Standards Council of Canada, 2017). According  to NRCan staff, a recent service review was conducted to understand the benefit  of services to the mining sector and who should be providing them. As a result,  some analytical services were transferred to private industry, but not the  conformity assessment services or laboratory proficiency assessments. Examples of  analytical services transferred to the private sector are: Total Respirable  Dust (TRD), Respirable Combustible Dust (RCD) and Respirable Quartz Dust, using  X-ray Diffractometry and direct-on-filter (XRD). Responsibility was transferred  from CanmetMINING to the following laboratories: Concord Analytical; Institut  de recherché Robert-Sauvé en santé et en sécurité du travail (IRSST); Vale; and  SGS. Interviewees did note that the CCRMP  and PTP-MAL services provide confidence to the public through reliable and  certified analytical information. This was identified as important following  several incidents in which the reliability of assays made available to  investors was questioned.</p>
<h2 id="4.0">4.0	Evaluation Findings: Performance</h2>
<p> As noted above (section 2.3, Table 4, p. 9), a logic model was developed at the outset of the evaluation and became the basis for the assessment of performance. Because no logic model was in place prior to this, performance information was not specifically tracked according to the intended outputs and outcomes of the sub-program.</p>
<h3 id="4.1">4.1	Efficiency and Economy – Partially Demonstrated</h3>
<table class="table table-bordered">
<tr>
<td><p><strong>Summary:</strong><br/>
      From 2010-11 to 2014-15, the Mining Innovation sub-program expended approximately 88% of its available budget. Of this, VNR made up approximately 25% of actual expenditures with the remaining 75% coming from ongoing A-base resources. All sub-program components generate VNR through the implementation of service fees and it is used to fund the sub-program as a whole, regardless of where it is generated.<br/><br/>
In delivering the sub-program, NRCan works collaboratively with multiple stakeholders from industry, provinces and territories, other federal departments, academia and international agencies. This collaboration helps reduce the risk of duplication of effort and facilitates the leveraging of resources and expertise. It also helps the sub-program identify the needs of the mining industry related to innovation. However, the evaluation found a potential opportunity for the sub-program to strengthen its leadership in the area of mining innovation. In particular, CanmetMINING could build on its strong collaboration and existing expertise to work with stakeholders to better focus innovation R&amp;D in the mining sector (e.g., develop a national strategy on mining innovation). This could help increase the competitiveness of the industry while also ensuring priorities reflect common objectives.<br/><br/>
In addition, CanmetMINING maintains multiple accreditations that increase its reliability and enable it to deliver the CCRMP and PTP-MAL components of the sub-program. These standards ensure a level of consistency in different areas of program management.<br/><br/>
However, the evaluation found that performance measurement was generally done at the level of individual projects rather than for the sub-program as a whole. This presents a potential challenge to the sub-program to ensure it is delivered effectively, efficiently and economically.

<h4>Resource Utilization</h4>
<p>Funding for the Mining Innovation sub-program is a mix of ongoing A-base resources (62%) and VNR (38%). It was also noted that VNR is generated and expended by both the Mining Innovation and Green Mining sub-programs. While Mining Innovation accounted for 59% of VNR expenditures, the remaining VNR would have been expended under Green Mining.</p>
<p>Financial data and interviews identified that all sub-program components  expend and generate VNR through a fee for services delivered to mining industry  clients. This is consistent with the <em>Policy  on Special Revenue Spending Authorities</em> (2000) (replaced on  April 1, 2017 with the <em>Directive on  Charging and Special Financial Authorities</em>.) , which notes that VNR “is provided to fund  fluctuating demands from user groups, which while consistent with program  objectives, would otherwise jeopardize the relatively stable ‘core’ budget of  the department”.</p>
<p>From 2010-11 to 2014-15, the Mining Innovation sub-program expended approximately 88% of available funds (A-base and VNR); however, the sub-program appears to have only expended approximately 59% of generated VNR over this time period. ‘Overhead’, which includes all activities not directly assigned to a specific component of the sub-program (e.g., finance, administration, etc.), accounts for the majority of sub-program expenditures (41%), with the remaining expenditures being allocated across the four components. When considering only VNR, the majority is generated by the CCRMP (51%) and Mining Extraction Innovation (40%) components, as illustrated in Table 5 (below), while the majority of VNR expended is allocated to ‘overhead’ (41%), followed by Mining Extraction Innovation (31%) and Mineral and Metallurgical Processing (25%).</p>

<p>Moreover, the evaluation found that sub-program project planning is sometimes  done based on client-specific needs under each program component, rather than  at a more strategic level that specifically identifies what activities or  projects are needed to achieve the intended outcomes of the sub-program. While  the use of VNR affords the flexibility to respond to the demand for services, planning  at the component-level based on client needs or requests creates the potential  risk that the sub-program will prioritize projects based on client demand  rather than addressing broader policy objectives. CanmetMINING recognizes the  potential risk of depending on external funding sources, particularly during economic  downturns in the Canadian mining industry, as was the case during the time  period covered by this evaluation, and is working towards “…stabilizing its  revenues, which is essential to maintain its capacity to undertake innovative,  well-aligned strategic programs”(CanmetMINING. <em>Integrated  business plan, 2013)</em>.</p>
<h4>Partnerships  and Collaboration</h4>
<p>According  to the Canada Mining Innovation Council (CMIC), in 2014 “there [were] over 100  organizations with an emphasis on assisting the mining industry including 12  separate research, development and innovation (RDI) organizations scattered  across Canada, not including the centres of expertise in universities and  colleges”. In its annual report, CMIC noted that “the level of collaboration  between the centres is not sufficient to drive transformative change in the industry”. However, the evaluation found that of the  organizations identified through the literature and stakeholder interviews,  these organizations were sharing expertise – including with CanmetMINING – and  were working with academia to serve the interest of mining companies through  the exchange of knowledge, technology, and networks. Examples of organizations  that were part of the networks include: Centre for Excellence in Mining  Innovation (CEMI); Deep Mining Research Consortium (DMRC); International  Minerals Innovation Institute (IMII); Mining Innovation, Rehabilitation and  Applied Research Corporation (MIRARCO); CMIC; Canadian Institute of Mining,  Metallurgy and Petroleum (CIM); and Expertise de calibre international en  traitement de minerais (COREM). </p>
<p>A report from the 2015 Energy and Mines Ministers’ Conference (EMMC)  highlights that “collaboration is a key aspect of innovation leadership in  Canada’s energy and minerals sectors” because of “the high complexity of  resource production and use…to ensure ongoing innovation, despite the currently  challenged economic conditions”. Similarly, EMMC identified public and private  sector partnerships as appropriate and important since they help “focus limited  capacity and resources on areas where the challenges are the greatest”. </p>
<p>Much of the work of the Mining Innovation sub-program is conducted collaboratively  with multiple stakeholders from industry, provinces and territories, other  federal departments, academia and international agencies. More specifically,  the sub-program “…collaborates with industry and academia to address pressing  needs…[and] partners with private industry to develop and deploy innovative  green mining processes and technologies”( CanmetMINING, <em>Integrated  business plan, 2013)</em> This  is consistent with the 2008 Pan-Canadian Mining Research and Innovation  Strategy, which recognizes the importance of strategic collaboration, as well  as activities undertaken by CanmetMINING related to the Mining Innovation sub-program  (e.g., collaborating with provinces and territories, standard bodies, and other  stakeholders). </p>
<p>As stated in the 2013-17 CanmetMINING <em>Integrated  business plan,</em> in  conducting its work, the sub-program is “in a constant dialogue with key  innovation-driven organisations such as the Canada Mining Innovation Council  (CMIC) to discuss collaborative opportunities and take advantage of synergies”.  It is stated that often, this collaboration and partnership is done through  committees and working groups. In addition to CREEN (discussed above) key  examples of these committees include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Green Mining Initiative Advisory Committee (GMIAC), which is co-chaired  by CanmetMINING and an industry member, and consists of 20 members from  industry, academia, non-governmental organizations, other federal government  departments, and provinces and territories. Through this committee, CanmetMINING  obtains expert advice on its work, which ensures it aligns with, and is  relevant to, the needs of stakeholders.</li>
<li>Green Mining Initiative Intergovernmental Working Group (GMI-IGWG), which  is a partnership between CanmetMINING (including this sub-program) and  provinces and territories. Through this partnership, the working group helps  “address barriers to the adoption of green mining technologies in Canada.</li>
</ul>
<p>Through these partnerships and  collaborations the sub-program also leverages resources (financial or in-kind),  where possible, to share costs and expertise. For example, according to the Standing  Committee on Natural Resources (June 2014), in the  area of REE R&amp;D, the sub-program has leveraged “five dollars from industry,  in terms of in-kind contribution, for every dollar invested by the federal  government”. For the sub-program as a whole, NRCan’s Departmental Performance  Reports identified leveraging of approximately $2.3 million in 2012-13 ($1,900,000  from industry, and $437,000 from non-industry) and $2.0 million in 2013-14 ($1,557,000 from industry, and $482,000 from non-industry), respectively. The evaluation also  found clear evidence of leveraged resources (both in-kind and financial) on a  project-by-project basis.</p>
<p>Collaboration and partnerships through committees and working groups enables  the Mining Innovation sub-program to undertake consultations with stakeholders  to identify needs and priorities related to innovation. These consultations in  turn help reduce duplication by ensuring alignment of priorities and facilitating  the sharing or leveraging of resources and expertise when possible. </p>
<h4>National  Governance</h4>
<p>All  interviewees (internal and external) identified that NRCan has a key role to  play in strengthening leadership of the federal government by putting forward  updated, integrated, and coordinated mining innovation needs assessments that  link R&amp;D activities to the broader mining innovation policy agenda and  related industry needs. These interviewees felt this would help determine the  needs of stakeholders, including CanmetMINING and the Mining Innovation sub-program,  and reduce the risk of duplication or potential competition while coordinating  investment in, and attention to, common goals that might help increase  competitiveness of the industry.</p>
<p>This is consistent with challenges the  Mining Association of Canada suggests need to be addressed in the Canadian  mining industry to continue to advance innovation (<em>Facts  &amp; figures of the Canadian mining industry, 2014</em>, pp. 50-51). These challenges include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A fragmented minerals sector innovation continuum (i.e., from R&amp;D to  demonstration and deployment) resulting from a lack of national scale  coordination and industry R&amp;D and innovation funding; and</li>
<li>A mining sector that lacks the ability to network effectively and focus  Canada’s R&amp;D and innovation community while also integrating industry  service providers into the innovation continuum.</li>
</ul>
<p>External interviewees noted that the federal government could build on  the expertise and strong tradition of collaboration already in place in  universities, provinces and territories, and other research centres for the  transfer of innovations to the mining industry and the development of a collaborative  national strategy on mining innovation, where the role of each of the various  stakeholders would be outlined. Related to this, many external interviewees expressed  that, at the time of the evaluation, CanmetMINING did not play a strong  coordination role in mining innovation and suggested CanmetMINING could play a  leadership role by establishing such a national strategy on mining innovation. </p>
<p>To that end, CanmetMINING has played a leadership role by undertaking a  number of initiatives, such as creating the Canadian Mining Innovation Council  to provide a forum “…to enable better communication, collaboration and action  on strategic priorities across Canada and with global partners” (Canadian  Mining Innovation Council (2008), as well as undertaking multiple national-level studies on barriers to  innovation in mining and state of commercialization in mining.</p>
<h4>Standardization</h4>
<p>The  literature review revealed that, at the time of the evaluation, CanmetMINING,  which administers this sub-program, was the only federal organization  accredited to ISO 9001:2008 and ISO/IEC 17043 (Currently, it maintains  accreditation to ISO/IEC 17043 and 17025). ISO 9001:2008 is a standard for the general management of quality of  any process or area of management including: project planning; financial  management; human resource management; administrative services; and  verification of business operations.  ISO/IEC 17043 is a standard specific to  proficiency testing programs, such as PTP-MAL. In order for the sub-program to  continue to accredit clients to the standard of ISO 17025, CanmetMINING must  maintain this accreditation.</p>
<h4>Performance Monitoring</h4>
<p>No evidence was found of a performance measurement strategy that would  enable the monitoring of intended outcomes at the sub-program level. Rather,  the evaluation identified that performance measurement was generally done at  the level of the individual projects, with sometimes inconsistent reporting and  documentation practices across projects (e.g., document filing process, mix of  hard and soft copy files, version control issues, lack of reporting against  outputs). For instance, information related to the production of outputs was  generally only available at the level of the individual mining companies. As a  result, it was difficult to identify a mechanism through which the sub-program  could systematically monitor financial and non-financial performance on an  ongoing basis in order to correct course where necessary and ensure the  effective, efficient and economic delivery of the sub-program.</p>
<h3 id="4.2">4.2	Effectiveness – Partially Demonstrated</h3>
<table class="table table-bordered">
<tr>
<td><p><strong>Summary:</strong><br/>
      The evaluation determined that the sub-program has made progress towards achieving its four intended immediate outcomes. It was also possible to align project-level information with the first intermediate outcome (adoption of mining innovation [techniques, technologies, etc.] by industry stakeholders) showing that clients are adopting innovations tested or developed in collaboration with the sub-program, but the evaluation did not find evidence of these being adopted by industry at large. <br/><br/>
In addition, the evaluation found evidence that the sub-program is contributing to some extent to the second intermediate outcome (improved productivity [including health and safety components] of the industry). Nevertheless, some concern was raised by internal and external stakeholder interviewees that this outcome may be beyond the reach of the sub-program.<br/><br/>
No unintended impacts were identified.
</p></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Internal stakeholders suggested that intermediate and ultimate outcomes  identified in the logic model are ambitious and may not accurately reflect  impacts the sub-program could reasonably be expected to achieve. Likewise,  external interviewees felt these outcomes might be beyond the reach of the  sub-program given its focus on client-driven needs and transactions. As noted  in section 4.1, performance measurement was often done at the level of the  individual projects rather than for the program as a whole, thus limiting the  program’s capacity for ongoing monitoring at the sub-program level. </p>
<p>Nevertheless, as part of the evaluation, it was possible to align project-level  performance information with the four immediate outcomes and two intermediate  outcomes (adoption of mining innovation [techniques and technologies, etc.] by  industry stakeholders; and improved  productivity [including health and safety components] of the mining  industry) identified in the sub-program logic  model. </p>
<p><strong>Immediate Outcomes 1 and 3: Reduced  risks associated with adopting new techniques and technologies; and increased  awareness and understanding of innovative technologies by industry stakeholders  – Partially Demonstrated</strong> </p>
<p>Findings from case studies and the file review show that some key  outputs were produced that contributed to reduced risks associated with  industry adopting new techniques and technologies. The evaluation found that in  many cases, this risk was reduced by increasing awareness and understanding  among industry stakeholders of innovative technologies and new techniques. In  particular, CanmetMINING laboratories conducted research and provided the  necessary knowledge and tools to increase stakeholder understanding of new  techniques and technologies that would then help reduce the risks associated  with their adoption by industry. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Projects associated with dynamic and static ground support (rock bolt)  R&amp;D made test results from new and innovative technologies publicly  available to increase awareness and understanding of these to help reduce the  risk of implementing new ground support technologies underground;</li>
<li>Development of a testing protocol for friction bolts, which had not been  done successfully in a laboratory under dynamic conditions anywhere in the world,  enabled the evaluation of the behaviour of these bolts under dynamic  conditions;</li>
<li>Testing of the synthetic cable enabled stakeholders to understand its behaviour  and to take steps to reduce the risks associated with its implementation; and</li>
<li>Development of process flowsheets and reference materials for REE and  chromite R&amp;D projects increased the development of techniques and  technologies to access these mineral deposits, which are described by  stakeholders as a key element of pre-feasibility for the eventual development  of efficient processing techniques for REE.</li>
</ul>
<p>CanmetMINING staff also reported on the sub-program’s efforts to  understand barriers to industry’s adoption of technologies. For example, at the  time of the evaluation, CanmetMINING was conducting a study on the state of  commercialization of green technologies to identify barriers to adoption.</p>
<p>The sub-program includes collaboration and partnership with multiple  stakeholders through committees and working groups (e.g., CREEN, GMIAC, GMI-IGWG, etc.). Through  these forums, as well as publications, the sub-program is able to share  findings and information with stakeholders to increase their awareness and  understanding of new techniques.</p>
<p><strong>Immediate outcome 2: Increased access  to relevant markets for industry stakeholders – Partially Demonstrated</strong></p>
<p>The accuracy of laboratory measurements related to both CCRMP and  PTP-MAL are important to the mining industry because it is a cornerstone of  commodity valuation. CRMs, for instance, can be used to validate the mineral  analysis used to quantify the mineral concentrate and provide confidence to  potential buyers that the stated mineral values are accurate. As a result, the  use of CRMs affects decisions concerning the economic viability of exploration  and mining, the value of the commodity, and actions to safeguard the  environment. Similarly, by improving the reliability of measurements performed  in the laboratory and serving as a control to verify the accuracy and precision  of instrumentation/analytical methods, the conformity assessment services delivered  through PTP-MAL increase access of the Canadian mining industry to relevant  markets by giving confidence to investors and other markets in the quality of  the work and analytical data produced by the Canadian mining industry.</p>
<p>To perform chemical and statistical analysis, the  sub-program relies on donated samples of raw materials from Canadian companies  in order to produce these reference levels. From 2010 to 2015, the sub-program performed chemical and statistical  analysis and issued certificates for more than 22,200 bottles of certified reference  materials (CRMs) that are sold within Canada (33% of sales) and to a range of  clients internationally (67% of sales), which led to worldwide annual industry sales  of approximately $1.4 million. Over this same time period, over 80 analytical  laboratories worldwide participated in each PTP-MAL cycle.</p>
<p>As noted previously, if a laboratory wants to be accredited to  ISO/IEC 17025, which is strongly recommended for being listed on the stock  exchange, it must participate in the PTP-MAL program. With this perspective, stakeholder interviewees noted that  services provided through the CCRMP and PTP-MAL respond to the need of mining  companies and investors related to exploring and/or opening new mines with more  confidence to inform decisions related to investments, which might include  taking the risk to access new markets. In particular, accuracy and confidence  in the chemical analysis used to determine the quantity and quality of  potential mineral deposits is important to inform decision makers and investors  prior to risking the millions of dollars required to develop new mines.  According to the Standing  Committee on Natural Resources (June 2014), these services are also critical to support  CanmetMINING research projects, such as those related to the development of new  mineral separation processes, including the REE project, which is “essential to  the Canadian economy and global competitiveness”. The search for a more  efficient and cost-competitive process to produce REE from Canadian deposits  required the production of new reference materials and a process to validate  laboratory proficiency when dealing with the complex mineralogy in these types  of new deposits (<em>Mines to  markets Natural Resources Canada rare earth elements technical workshop:  Summary report, </em>NRCan 2015<em>)</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Immediate outcome 4: Increased  understanding of industry’s needs, priorities, and requirements – Partially  Demonstrated</strong></p>
<p>The  evaluation identified that the sub-program has undertaken activities to  increase its understanding of industry’s needs, priorities, and requirements.  This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Participation in various international, provincial and territorial, and  industry conferences;</li>
<li>Establishment of the CREEN to share information and best practices  related to research and development in mining;</li>
<li>Initiating and participating in the Deep Mining Research Consortium;</li>
<li>Acting as an external observer on the CEMI’s Board of Directors;</li>
<li>Hosting annual technical advisory committees related to CCRMP; and </li>
<li>Chairing, co-chairing, and/or participating in a variety of additional  committees related to mining innovation on which there is also representation  from the Canadian mining industry, analytical laboratories, other levels of  government, and other government departments.</li>
</ul>
<p>These fora provide the sub-program with the opportunity to consult and  communicate with its stakeholders to facilitate an understanding of the needs,  priorities, and requirements of various mining industry stakeholders. While the  mechanisms are in place to do this, the evaluation was unable to confirm the  extent to which this outcome has been achieved.</p>
<p><strong>Intermediate outcome 1: Adoption of  mining innovation (techniques, technologies, etc.) by industry stakeholders – Partially  Demonstrated</strong></p>
<p>The evaluation identified a few examples of clients implementing  innovations that were tested or developed in collaboration with the sub-program;  however, it did not find evidence that the mining industry at large was adopting  innovations (techniques, technologies, etc.). Examples of client-specific  innovations implemented by clients include: ContiscanTM real-time  rope monitoring for mine hoisting, which was licensed in 2012 and became  commercially available in 2013; fibre reinforced shotcrete, a new type of  ground support, which is one of the main support types use at Nickel Rim South  Mine; and a minerals processing flowsheet, which has been used by at least one  company to prepare its techno-economic assessment of a developing mine. CanmetMINING staff indicated that they  continue to work with clients after the R&amp;D knowledge or technologies have  been made available in an effort to ensure their use and adoption by clients. </p>
<p>However, CanmetMINING staff identified potential challenges to the  adoption of mining innovations by industry stakeholders, namely that new  technologies often require regulatory changes that can take years, and Canadian  mining companies rarely want to be the first to adopt a new technology if it  has not been tested elsewhere. The evaluation could not identify the extent to  which these challenges were impeding adoption by industry. </p>
<p>Some internal and external interviewees felt that this outcome might be  ambitious and may be beyond the reach of the program; however, sub-program  documentation identifies improving adoption of innovation by the mining  industry as part of its objective.</p>
<p><strong>Intermediate outcome</strong> <strong>2:  Improved productivity (including health and safety components) of the mining  industry – Partially Demonstrated</strong></p>
<p>According to an impact study commissioned by NRCan in 2015, the  sub-program is contributing to some extent to improved productivity (including  health and safety components) of the mining industry. The purpose of this <em>Green Mining Initiative Impact Study </em>was  to quantify and monetize various socioeconomic impacts, including economic  productivity and miner health and safety (including changes to codes and  regulations), resulting from NRCan supported technologies and projects. The  study considered 13 projects, including seven from the Mining Innovation sub-program.  As shown in Table 6, six of these seven projects were deemed to have  contributed to impacts of decreased workplace injuries and fatalities and/or  increased productivity/time savings.</p>

<p>More specifically, this 2015 study indicated that some of these projects  are contributing to this outcome in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>The use of Contiscan removes the need to manually inspect hoist cables,  “…thereby reducing the need to shutdown the mine on a weekly basis, which  increases the productivity of the mine”. It is also expected to increase cost  savings related to increased productivity from being able to hoist greater  volume, reducing the number of cables required, and also improve system safety.</li>
<li>As a result of tests done as part the testing of tendons and other  ground support elements project, there is “an expected reduction in rock  bursts…[which] means fewer injuries…”.</li>
<li>As a result of the microseismic monitoring of oil sands project,  companies are able to “identify and fix shallow well failures in an effective  and timely manner…[which] would result in reduced well downtime and improved  production…”. </li>
</ul>
<p>Not withstanding the findings of this impact study, internal and external  interviewees expressed concern that this outcome may be beyond the reach of the  sub-program given its focus on client-driven needs and transactions through  individual projects, rather than addressing broader policy objectives to  contribute to this outcome.</p>
<h3 id="4.3">4.3	Factors Impacting the Achievement of Outcomes</h3>
<table class="table table-bordered">
<tr>
<td><p><strong>Summary:</strong><br/>
      Some factors were identified that could positively or negatively impact the ability of the sub-program to achieve its intended outcomes. These include: commodity prices; practices of other countries or investments in other sectors; financial, and non-financial risks; potential constraints associated with non-disclosure/intellectual property (IP) agreements; and collaboration among stakeholders.
</p></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>According to the document and literature reviews, the ability of the sub-program  to achieve its intended outcomes could be impacted by external factors such as  commodity prices, directions being taken by other countries, or investments in  other sectors. In 2013-14 for instance, CanmetMINING had identified that “…falling  [commodity] prices in Canada…resulted in a 7.9% decline in value of mineral  production between 2011 and 2012.” (CanmetMINING, <em>Integrated business plan, 2013)</em> In an unstable climate such as this,  mining industry stakeholders may not be able or willing to invest in new or  innovative techniques or related R&amp;D, thus making it difficult for the  sub-program to achieve its intended outcomes.</p>
<p>Similarly, if the tendency of other countries is towards protectionism,  there may be fewer markets for industry stakeholders to access, which could  decrease their competitiveness. CMIC also identified that investment in  innovation in the Canadian mining industry “is low and declining compared to  other sectors such as forestry, automotive and manufacturing, and is  approximately nine (9) times less than that of another competing country, Australia”  (<em> CMIC Annual Report 2014)</em>. This could present a potential challenge to the sub-program’s ability  to influence its intended ultimate outcome of an innovative and  globally-competitive Canadian mining industry.</p>
<p>In addition, CanmetMINING staff identified more specific factors that  might impede the adoption of mining innovation by industry stakeholders, such  as financial (e.g., return on investment), and non-financial (e.g.,  organizational culture change) risks that industry may be unwilling to assume.</p>
<p>Evidence from the file review, case studies, and interviews, also suggests  that IP, licensing, and confidentiality clauses that may be part of project  agreements can impact the adoption of innovation by target audiences. It was  noted that some projects are protected by non-disclosure agreements, thus  limiting the ability to share knowledge from these projects with the broader  mining industry. That said, non-disclosure/IP agreements are negotiated on a  case-by-case basis, so the sub-program is generally able to mitigate the impact,  including by trying to ensure projects focus on innovations that could benefit  the industry as a whole and working with multiple stakeholders to do so.</p>
<p>CanmetMINING management also noted that collaboration with some  stakeholders (e.g., CMIC) is important to the Canadian mining industry at the  national level, as it facilitates the sub-program’s ability to increase  stakeholder awareness and understanding of innovative techniques, which could  reduce risks associated with the adoption of these techniques. It also enables  the sub-program to increase its understanding of industry’s needs, priorities,  and requirements to ensure alignment of priorities.</p>
<h2 id="5.0">5.0	Conclusions and Recommendations</h2>
<h3 id="5.1">5.1	Conclusions</h3>
<p>The Canadian mining industry faces ongoing challenges to remain  competitive. As such, there is a continued need for support and collaborative  approaches for R&amp;D as well as conformity assessment services as these are enablers  to innovation and economic competitiveness. In this regard, the Mining  Innovation sub-program strives to assist the Canadian mining industry in  mitigating challenges through support for R&amp;D and the provision of  conformity assessment services. To deliver on this, the sub-program relies on  collaboration with the mining industry, private sector, other federal  government departments, other levels of government, research consortia, and  academia. However, the evaluation identified a need for improved national coordination  related to mining innovation given the number of stakeholders involved.</p>
<p>The evaluation found the Mining Innovation sub-program to be consistent  with the priorities of the Government of Canada, as well as NRCan’s strategic  objectives. The sub-program activities and objectives also align with federal  roles and responsibilities, and specifically, the NRCan mandate. Nevertheless,  it was determined that the sub-program’s distinct role in R&amp;D related to  mining innovation may not be clear to internal and external stakeholders given  the number of players involved in developing innovative mining practices.</p>
<p>In terms of performance, the evaluation found that the sub-program is  making some progress towards achieving its four immediate outcomes and both of  its intermediate outcomes.</p>
<p>Although the evaluation was unable to directly measure the efficiency  and economy of the sub-program, indirect measures suggest that the sub-program  uses some practices to ensure efficiency and economy. These include working  collaboratively and in partnership with multiple stakeholders (e.g., industry,  provinces and territories, other federal departments, academia and  international agencies), leveraging resources and expertise where possible, and  maintaining standardization of processes (i.e., accreditation). However, the  evaluation identified two gaps that could hinder the ability of the sub-program  to be as efficient and economic as possible, namely the absence of: a performance  measurement strategy that would enable the monitoring of intended outcomes at  the sub-program level; and a collaborative national strategy on mining  innovation to better focus innovation R&amp;D in the mining sector.</p>
<h3 id="5.2">5.2	Recommendations</h3>
<p>Based on the findings and conclusions of the evaluation, the following  recommendations are made to the Assistant Deputy Minister of LMS:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type:none">
<li><strong>Recommendation 1:</strong> LMS should identify and communicate to  stakeholders the roles of all parties relevant to mining innovation, and work  with appropriate partners to help identify priorities for R&amp;D related to  innovation in the Canadian mining sector.<br/><br/></li>
<li><strong>Recommendation 2</strong>: LMS should revisit the sub-program’s  design and delivery with specific consideration of the appropriate balance  between strategic priorities and client-specific needs. This should include  exploring whether other financial mechanisms/funding models would better  support program delivery. <br/><br/></li>
<li><strong>Recommendation 3</strong>: LMS should improve performance  measurement and reporting to ensure adequate information is available to assess  efficiency and effectiveness.</li>
</ul>
<p>For Mining Innovation activities, this means developing and implementing  a performance measurement strategy, including:  a logic model;  theory of change (i.e., identification of  risks, contexts, and assumptions that explain how the program is intended to be  delivered and achieve its intended outcomes); as well as performance  indicators, data sources, methods, and data collection and reporting frequency  for all elements of the logic model (i.e., activities, outputs, immediate,  intermediate, and ultimate outcomes). </p>
