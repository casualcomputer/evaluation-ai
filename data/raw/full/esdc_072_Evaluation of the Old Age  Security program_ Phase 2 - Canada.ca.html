<section>
<h3 id="h2.01-h3.01">Program description</h3>
<p>The Old Age  Security (OAS) program is the first pillar of Canada's retirement income  system. Program costs amounted to $51 billion in fiscal year 2017 to 2018<sup id="fn1-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn1"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>1</a></sup>,  including $500 million for the Allowances.</p>
<p>The OAS  program provides a basic pension upon which individuals may add income from  other sources, such as the Canada or Quebec Pension Plan (C/QPP), employer pension  plans and personal savings.</p>
<p>The OAS  program includes<sup id="fn2-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn2"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>2</a></sup>:</p>
<ul>
<li>the OAS pension: a basic pension to nearly all seniors</li>
<li>the Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS): a supplement to low-income seniors</li>
<li>the Allowances:
        <ul>
<li>Allowance (spousal Allowance): benefits to low-income near-seniors who are spouses of GIS  recipients</li>
<li>Allowance for the Survivor: benefits to low-income near-seniors who are widows or  widowers</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Near-seniors  are defined in this evaluation as individuals who are 60 to 64 years old.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3 id="h2.01-h3.02">Evaluation context</h3>
<p>The OAS evaluation was implemented in 2 phases.</p>
<p>Phase 1, completed in June 2018, focused on the labour market participation of OAS beneficiaries, the GIS top-up and service delivery. Key findings<sup id="fn3-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn3"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>3</a></sup> included the positive impact of the 2008 increase in the GIS earnings exemption (from $500 to $3,500) which:</p>
<ul>
<li>raised employment rates among recipients of the Allowances by 1 percentage point</li>
<li>raised average employment income by 15% among working Allowances recipients</li>
</ul>
<p>Phase 2 focuses on the Allowances and the deferral of the OAS pension:</p>
<ul>
<li>the rationale for the Allowances and the characteristics of recipients are examined as part of the first evaluation of the Allowances in the last 25 years</li>
<li>the work and income profile of those deferring their pension, in addition to the incidence of deferral, provide the first assessment of deferral since its introduction in 2013</li>
</ul>
<p>This evaluation supports efforts by the department to provide information to Canadians on deferral of the OAS pension and Canada Pension Plan (CPP) programs.</p>

<h3 id="h2.01-h3.03">The Old Age Security  pension and the Guaranteed Income Supplement contribute to reducing poverty in  Canada</h3>
<p>Recent  results<sup id="fn4-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn4"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>4</a></sup> indicate that:</p>
<ul>
<li>the  OAS program contributed to reducing the percentage of seniors below Statistics  Canada's Low Income Cut-Off (LICO) to 4% in 2015. This rate would have been 19  percentage points higher without the program</li>
<li>OAS  benefits represented 23% of seniors' after-tax income on average in 2015. The  contribution of benefits to after-tax income of seniors varies by income group,  with benefits representing 65% of income for those in the lowest income  quintile and 8% of income for those in the highest income quintile</li>
</ul>
<p>A previous  evaluation in 2012 also showed that the program contributes to reducing poverty  among seniors and that its benefits represent a significant proportion of  seniors' income<sup id="fn5-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn5"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>5</a></sup>.</p>

<h2 id="h2.02">Rationale for the  Allowances and profile of recipients</h2>
<p>The Allowances were introduced to help alleviate financial  difficulties of near-senior spouses of seniors, and then extended to widows and  widowers.</p>
<p><strong>1975</strong>: Introduction of the Allowance. 30% of married  women participated in the labour market in 1970<sup id="fn6-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn6"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>6</a></sup>.  Before the introduction of the Allowance, retirement of the husband led some  couples to live on a single OAS/GIS benefit, as only 1 spouse had the age  requirement to qualify for the OAS benefits.</p>
<p><strong>1978</strong>: Extension of Allowance eligibility to widows  and widowers to include the 6-month period following the death of the OAS  pension recipient.</p>
<p>This was to  recognize the difficult circumstances some near-senior spouses could face when  their older spouse passes away (including losing their Allowance benefits and  the OAS benefits of their spouse).</p>
<p><strong>1979</strong>: Extension of Allowance eligibility to widows  and widowers: 6-month limit was extended to continue until age 65 or  remarriage, whichever came first.</p>
<p><strong>1985</strong>: Extension of the Allowance eligibility to  widows and widowers: Allowance for the Survivor was introduced for all  near-senior widows and widowers.</p>
<p>Parliament  raised concerns about the financial situation of many near-seniors,  particularly single women, but it was too costly to expand the eligibility of  the Allowance to all near-seniors.</p>
<p>Widows'  vulnerability was highlighted:</p>
<ul>
<li>most  had been financial dependents for most of their lives</li>
<li>societal  norms encouraged them to perform only unpaid roles (mother, housekeeper,  community worker, etcetera)</li>
<li>many  would have difficulty finding paid work at the time</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2019</strong>: The spousal Allowance was introduced in 1975.  Since that time, the participation rate of women in the labour market has  doubled (64% of married women participated in the labour market in 2018 versus  30% in 1970<sup id="fn7-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn7"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>7</a></sup>).  This trend is likely to continue.</p>
<p>Recipients  of the Allowances represent a small proportion of all near-seniors but a  significant share of near-senior widows and spouses of seniors.</p>
<p>In 2016,  recipients of the Allowances represented:</p>
<ul>
<li>3%  of all near-seniors (78,810 recipients)</li>
<li>22%  of near-senior widows or widowers (24,900 recipients)</li>
<li>13%  of near-senior spouses of seniors (53,910 recipients)</li>
</ul>
<p>These  proportions have been decreasing, as income<sup id="fn8-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn8"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>8</a></sup> among near-seniors has increased.</p>

<section>
<h3 id="h2.02-h3.01">Conclusions on the  Allowances</h3>
<p>The Allowances are important for low-income near-seniors. Most recipients have very  low income and benefits represent a significant proportion of their income.</p>
<p>Most recipients of the Allowances continue to be predominantly women, most have low  levels of education and most had limited attachment to the labour market already  at 58 and 59 years old.</p>
<p>The limited attachment to the labour market of married women was central to the rationale  for introducing the Allowances. Social changes since the 1970s have been  significant but challenges remain for many near-seniors.</p>
<p>There are also many vulnerable individuals among other single near-seniors and other  near-senior couples whose marital status makes them ineligible for the  Allowances.</p>
<p>Even with similar financial situations to recipients of the Allowances, they do not  receive the same financial support from the federal government as recipients of  the Allowances. However, individuals in this age group may be eligible for  provincial or territorial assistance.</p>
<section>
<h4>Recommendation</h4>
<p>The department  should take into account the evaluation findings to inform its analysis on the  Allowances. </p>

<h2 id="h2.03">Deferral of the Old Age  Security pension</h2>
<p>Since 2013,  seniors have the option to defer the start of their OAS pension by up to 5 years  in exchange for a higher monthly payment.</p>
<p>The monthly  OAS pension amount is increased by 0.6% for every month the OAS pension is  deferred, up to a maximum of 36% (for delaying for 5 years), in addition  to regular indexation of OAS benefits. The deferred pension amount is  calculated on an actuarially neutral basis.</p>
<p>There are  data lags when assessing the characteristics of those who defer their OAS  pension.</p>
<ul>
<li>There  is a 5-year data lag to identify all individuals that deferred in a cohort that  reaches 65 years old. The data on the deferral decision is available only  once the person starts receiving their OAS pension (or once their application  is processed)</li>
<li>Complete  data on the first cohort of seniors who could have deferred for up to 5 years  was available at the end of 2018. Partial data is available for younger cohorts</li>
</ul>
<p>There is a  limited number of seniors deferring their OAS pension, but it is rising.</p>
<p>In 2018,  60,000 seniors received a deferred OAS pension, up from 3,500 in 2014 and  30,000 in 2016.</p>

<p>4% of  seniors in the first eligible cohort chose to defer their OAS pension (Employment  and Social Development Canada [ESDC], 2019b). This is in line with projections  from the Chief Actuary.</p>
<p>One of the  reasons few people choose to defer their OAS pension is awareness. A 2018 departmental  online survey found that awareness of OAS deferral was low, with 25% of 60 to 64-year-old  respondents aware they could defer their OAS pension<sup id="fn29-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn29"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>29</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The length  of deferral chosen varies among individuals<sup id="fn30-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn30"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>30</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Among  seniors who deferred their OAS pension, the length of deferral was 23 months on  average.</p>
<p>A third of  seniors deferring did so for a year or less and over 60% for 2 years or  less. Another 20% deferred for 2 to 3 years, while the remaining 20%  deferred for more than 3 years.</p>

<section>
<h3 id="h2.03-h3.01">Conclusions on Old Age Security deferral</h3>
<p>Most seniors worked during deferral.</p>
<p>Most of those deferring had high income. However, there were seniors deferring their OAS pension in all income groups.</p>
<p>Awareness of OAS pension deferral is low, as is the proportion of seniors who chose to defer. About a quarter of 60 to 64-year-olds are aware of this possibility and  4% of the first cohort of eligible seniors chose to defer.</p>
<p>Raising awareness on deferral will help Canadians make better retirement planning  decisions, including whether to continue working.</p>
<section>
<h4>Recommendation</h4>
<p>The department should continue to promote awareness of OAS pension deferral.</p>

<h2 id="h2.04">Management response and action plan</h2>
<section>
<h3 id="h2.04-h3.01">Overall management response</h3>
<p>The evaluation is integral to ensuring that the OAS program remains relevant and continues to meet its objectives.</p>
<p>The department agrees with all of the report's recommendations and is pleased to present the following management response.</p>
<section>
<h4>Recommendation 1</h4>
<p>The department  should take into account the evaluation findings to inform its analysis on the Allowances.</p>
<section>
<h5>Management response</h5>
<p>The department  agrees with this recommendation and welcomes the new data the evaluation  provides.</p>
<p>Historically,  the Allowances were designed to:</p>
<ul>
<li>recognize  the difficult circumstances that low-income couples face when living on only 1 pension until the other spouse becomes eligible, at age 65, for the OAS pension  and the GIS (the Allowance); and</li>
<li>assist  60 to 64-year-old widows or widowers who are facing financial difficulties and  have not remarried or become the common-law partner of another person (the  Allowance for the Survivor)</li>
</ul>
<p>The OAS program is part of an extensive network of income security programs in Canada.</p>
<p>Generally, income security for low-income persons under the age of 65 is a  provincial/territorial responsibility. There are various provincial/territorial  programs in place to help people navigate through financially difficult periods  in their lives.</p>
<p>While the evaluation has shown that other 60 to 64-year-old low-income individuals are  not eligible for the Allowances, low-income individuals in this age group, such  as single, separated or divorced individuals, who face financial hardship and  meet the eligibility requirements may be able to receive social assistance from  their province or territory of residence.</p>
<p>Furthermore, individuals who have contributed to the CPP or the Quebec Pension Plan are  eligible to start receiving benefits at age 60.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h5>Management action plan</h5>
<p>1.1 No additional action required.</p>
<p>Completion date: completed.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section>
<h4>Recommendation 2 </h4>
<p>The department  should continue to promote awareness of OAS pension deferral.</p>
<section>
<h5>Management response</h5>
<p>The department  agrees with this recommendation.</p>
<p>To measure  awareness about pension deferral provisions, the department undertook an online  survey in 2018, recruiting respondents among visitors, aged 40 to 64, to the canada.ca  website.</p>
<p>The survey  showed that awareness of the OAS pension deferral option was low, with only 17%  of respondents aware that they could defer their OAS pension for up to 5 years,  from age 65 to 70. Awareness was found to increase with age, income,  education, and financial literacy. In addition, women had slightly lower  awareness rates than men.</p>
<p>The department  identified a series of actions to increase Canadians' awareness of the OAS  deferral option and to ensure that Canadians have access to information about  OAS deferral.</p>
<p>Several of  these activities are already underway and include:</p>
<ul>
<li>using  ESDC's social media channels to raise awareness, as well as publicly releasing  the results of ESDC's online survey</li>
<li>disseminating  articles on pension deferral in publications or websites targeting near-retirees</li>
<li>reviewing  Government information such as ESDC's website, the OAS/GIS automatic enrolment  letter and application form, and community outreach material</li>
</ul>
<p>The department  will continue its ongoing activities aimed at increasing awareness about OAS  deferral and explore options to monitor the reach of its activities.</p>
</section>

<h2 id="h2.05">Annex 1: Old Age  Security program description</h2>
<section>
<h3 id="h2.05-h3.01">Old Age Security pension</h3>
<section>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p>In January  2019, the OAS pension provided benefits to 6.3 million seniors with the  full basic pension amounting to $601.45 per month (or about $7,200 per year). All  benefits under the OAS program are indexed quarterly.</p>
<p>The OAS recovery  tax, which is part of the <em>Income Tax Act</em>,  requires all higher-income pensioners to repay part, or all, of their OAS  pension if their individual income exceeds a threshold. For the 2018 tax year,  seniors must repay $0.15 for every dollar of income exceeding $75,910. Benefits  are completely repaid when income reaches $123,386 (for those not receiving a  deferred OAS pension).</p>
</section>
<section>
<h4>Eligibility requirements</h4>
<p>To qualify,  a person living in Canada at the time of application must be 65 years or older and have resided in Canada for at least 10 years after age 18.</p>
<p>The full  basic OAS pension is payable to seniors who have resided in Canada for at least 40 years after age 18.</p>
<p>A partial  pension is paid to seniors who have lived in Canada for at least 10 years after age 18, and their benefits are prorated at the rate of one fortieth of the full pension for each  complete year of residence.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section>
<h3 id="h2.05-h3.02">Guaranteed Income Supplement</h3>
<section>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p>In January  2019,GIS benefits were paid to 2 million low-income seniors and could reach $898.32 per month for single seniors and $540.77 per month for seniors  who were married or in a common-law relationship (or up to about $10,800 or  $6,500 per year respectively).</p>
</section>
<section>
<h4>Eligibility requirements</h4>
<p>In order to  be eligible for the GIS, a person must receive the OAS pension, be a legal resident of Canada and have income, or combined income for couples, below the  maximum annual thresholds.</p>
<p>Single seniors qualified for the GIS with incomes up to $18,240 per year and up to $24,096 for senior couples in January 2019.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section>
<h3 id="h2.05-h3.03">The Allowances:  Allowance (spousal) and the Allowance for the Survivor</h3>
<section>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p>In January  2019, the Allowance was paid to 51,000 people and the Allowance for the  Survivor to 22,000 people. Benefits can reach $1,142.22 per month for the  Allowance and $1,361.56 per month for the Allowance for the Survivor (or about  $13,700 and $16,300 per year respectively, based on January 2019 rates).</p>
</section>
<section>
<h4>Eligibility requirements</h4>
<p>In order to  qualify for the Allowances, a person must be 60 to 64 years old, be a  legal resident of Canada and have resided in Canada for at least 10 years  after the age of 18.</p>
<p>In  addition, a person must be a low-income widow or widower to qualify for the  Allowance for the Survivor, or the spouse or common-law partner of a recipient  of the GIS to qualify for the Allowance.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2 id="h2.06">Annex 2: Key findings of  phase 1 of the evaluation</h2>
<p>Many factors contributed to the increase in the employment rate of seniors and  near-seniors, including among OAS beneficiaries, notably growth in the service  sector, technological advances and improved health levels. The increase in the  GIS earnings exemption in 2008 increased employment rates among recipients of  the Allowances by 1 percentage point and increased average employment income  among working GIS and Allowances recipients.</p>
<p>The GIS top-up reached many groups of vulnerable seniors, as did other OAS benefits. For  the average top-up recipient, the top-up represented 4% of OAS benefits and was  equivalent to 10% of their other sources of income.</p>
<p>With population aging and increases in the number of OAS beneficiaries, total  administrative costs of the OAS program have increased from $118 million  in fiscal year 2007 to 2008 to $177 million in fiscal year 2016 to 2017. Administrative  costs represented about 0.4% of program costs throughout this period.</p>
<p>Some of the  most relevant indicators of service delivery quality are monitored closely by  the department; notably, access to Service Canada agents, timeliness of benefit  receipt, take‑up and payment accuracy.</p>
<p>However, the client satisfaction survey conducted on behalf of Service Canada was  discontinued in 2010, leading to an important knowledge gap since then.</p>
<section>
<h3 id="h2.06-h3.01">Recommendation</h3>
<p>Consider regularly monitoring client satisfaction with OAS service delivery, including monitoring client satisfaction of the various service delivery channels.</p>

<section>
<h3>Technical study: ESDC  (2019a), "Recipients of the Allowances Program: a Historical Perspective"</h3>
<section>
<h4>Description:</h4>
<p>This report  uses T1 data from the Canada Revenue Agency. Its purpose was to examine the  characteristics of the recipients of the Allowances, how their profile has  changed over time, the rationale behind the introduction of the Allowances in  the 1970s, and whether the Allowances continue to address a demonstrable need  today. Additionally, this report illustrates the characteristics of other low-income near-seniors who are not eligible for the Allowances.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h4>Limitations:</h4>
<p>Reliable  data on the characteristics of recipients of the Allowances was only available  back to 1998. Ideally, comparison to Allowance recipients back to 1975 would  have been useful to examine changes to beneficiaries since the introduction of  the program.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Technical study: ESDC  (2019b), "Who Defers the Start of their OAS pension?"</h3>
<section>
<h4>Description:</h4>
<p>This paper uses linked administrative data from the Canada Revenue Agency (T1) and the OAS  program. The report examines to what extent the department can monitor the characteristics  of seniors deferring their OAS pension. It also provides a profile of  individuals who defer the start of their OAS pension and illustrates the extent  to which seniors are deferring their OAS pension.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h4>Limitations:</h4>
<p>Complete  data on OAS deferral of each cohort of 65year-olds is only available with a  5-year delay. Therefore, most of the analysis had to be based on the cohort who  reached 65 years old in 2013.</p>
<p>It was not  possible to find a methodology to measure the impact of OAS deferral on the employment  rates of seniors. No appropriate control group could be found. The report  shows, however, that employment rates are high while seniors are deferring  their OAS pension.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Technical study: ESDC (2016b), "Participation in the Old Age Security Program – National Household  Survey"</h3>
<section>
<h4>Description:</h4>
<p>This report  uses data from the National Household Survey. The report examines participation  in the OAS program, take-up rates among different sub-groups of the population,  and presents a financial profile of beneficiaries of the Allowances. These  findings help to show how the Allowances continue to address a demonstrable  need.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h4>Limitations:</h4>
<p>The report  uses older data from 2011.</p>
