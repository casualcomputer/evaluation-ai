<h2 id="h2.5">Abstract</h2>
<p>In 2008, the Canadian government  significantly increased the work earnings exemption on benefits for low-income  seniors (Guaranteed Income Supplement and Allowances). The new policy allows  seniors to earn up to $3500 without having their benefits reduced. This paper  examines the impact of this policy change on labour market outcomes, using T1  tax data. To accomplish this, the study uses a control group in a  difference-in-difference framework. Results show the policy increased  employment rates by 1 percentage point (p.p.) among 60 to 64 year old  recipients. Among 60 to 64 year old recipients who worked for an employer, the  policy increased work earnings by 15%. Results for older seniors were not as  conclusive, but suggested similar increases in work earnings among those who  worked. These results are significant given the relatively small policy change  involved.</p>

<h2 id="h2.7">1. Introduction</h2>
<p>In 2008, the Canadian government  significantly increased the work earnings exemption on benefits for low-income  seniors (Guaranteed Income Supplement and Allowances). The new policy allows  seniors to earn up to $3500 without having their benefits reduced. This paper  examines the impact of this policy change on labour market outcomes, using a  control group in a difference-in-difference framework to take into account the  increase in labour market participation of all seniors during this period. Results  show the policy increased employment rates among 60 to 64 year old recipients  and work earnings among those who worked. Results for older seniors were not as  conclusive, but suggested similar increases in work earnings among those who  worked.</p>
<p>The Old Age Security (OAS) program is the  first pillar of Canada’s retirement income system. It provides a basic pension  to nearly all seniors, and a supplement to low-income seniors. The OAS program  provides a modest base upon which individuals may add income from other  sources, such as the Canada or Quebec Pension Plan (C/QPP), retirement pensions  and personal savings. The benefits under the OAS program include the OAS  pension, the Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) and the Allowances (ALW).</p>
<p>This paper examines one of the themes of  the evaluation of the OAS program: the employment impacts of the 2008 increase  in the GIS earnings exemption. This study is a part of the overall work being  conducted for the evaluation of the OAS program.</p>
<p>The paper is divided as follows: <a href="#h2.8">Section 2</a> of the report provides a summary of the OAS  program. <a href="#h2.9">Section 3</a> examines the data used in the  report, <a href="#h2.10">Section 4</a> presents the analysis and <a href="#h2.11">Section 5</a> offers conclusions.</p>

<h2 id="h2.8">2. The Old Age Security program</h2>
<p>This section presents a general description  of the different components of the OAS program and of eligibility rules. The  OAS program is a cornerstone of Canada’s retirement income system. The program  includes the OAS pension, the GIS and the Allowances. The OAS pension is a  quasi-universal basic pension received by seniors aged 65 years and older. The  OAS program provides additional support through the income-tested GIS to  low-income seniors with little or no other income. In addition, the Allowance  and the Allowance for the Survivor are paid to low-income individuals aged 60  to 64 who are the spouses or common-law partners of GIS recipients or who are  widows or widowers.</p>
<section>
<h3 id="h2.8-3.1">2.1 Old Age Security pension</h3>
<p>The OAS pension is paid to Canada’s seniors  in recognition of the contribution they have made to Canadian society, the  economy, and their community. In July 2015, the OAS pension provided benefits  to 5.6 million seniors with the full basic pension amounting to $564.87 per  month (or about $6,800 per year). All benefits under the OAS program are  indexed quarterly.</p>
<p>Eligibility for the OAS pension is based on  years of residence in Canada. In order to qualify, a person living in Canada at  the time of application must be 65 years or older, and have resided in Canada  for at least 10 years after the age of 18.<sup id="fn1-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn1"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>1</a></sup> The full  basic OAS pension is payable to seniors who have resided in Canada for at least  40 years after age 18. A partial pension is paid to seniors who have lived in  Canada for at least 10 years after age 18, and their benefits are prorated at  the rate of 1 fortieth of the full pension for each complete year of residence.<sup id="fn2-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn2"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>2</a></sup></p>
<p>The OAS Recovery Tax, which is part of the <em>Income Tax Act</em>, requires all  higher-income pensioners to repay part of their OAS pension if their individual  income exceeds a threshold. For the 2015 tax year, seniors must repay $0.15 for  every dollar of income exceeding $72,809. Benefits are completely repaid when  income reaches $118,055.<sup id="fn3-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn3"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>3</a></sup> The recovery tax can be deducted at  the source, but final amounts are determined when seniors file their income tax  returns each year.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3 id="h2.8-3.2">2.2 Guaranteed Income  Supplement</h3>
<p>When seniors have little or no other  income, the GIS can be added to their OAS pension.<sup id="fn4-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn4"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>4</a></sup> In July  2015, the GIS was paid to 1.7 million low-income seniors and could reach  $765.93 per month for single seniors and $507.87 per month for seniors that  were married or in a common-law relationship (or up to about $9,200 or $6,100  per year respectively).<sup id="fn5-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn5"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>5</a></sup> Adding the OAS pension and GIS, OAS  benefits can reach $16,000 and $13,000 per year respectively.</p>
<p>In order to qualify for the GIS, a person  must receive the OAS pension and have family income below the maximum annual  thresholds.<sup id="fn6-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn6"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>6</a></sup> GIS benefits are reduced by $0.50  for every dollar of income, other than the OAS pension and the GIS,<sup id="fn7-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn7"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>7</a></sup> until it reaches $2,048 for single seniors and $4,080 for couples, then by  $0.75 for every dollar of other income between $2,048 and $4,544 for single  seniors and $4,096 to $7,648 for couples. When income exceeds these amounts,  GIS benefits are then reduced by $0.50 for every dollar of other income.<sup id="fn8-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn8"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>8</a></sup> This implies that single seniors qualified for the GIS with incomes up to  $17,136 per year and up to $22,608 for senior couples in July 2015.<sup id="fn9-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn9"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>9</a></sup></p>

<h3 id="h2.8-3.3">2.3 Allowances</h3>
<p>The Allowances are designed to recognize  the difficult circumstances faced by many low-income couples living on only 1  pension until the other spouse reaches age 65 and qualifies for his or her OAS  pension, as well as by 60 to 64 year old low-income widows or widowers. In July  2015, the Allowance was paid to 56,000 people and the Allowance for the  Survivor to 24,000 people. Benefits can reach $1,072.74 per month for the  Allowance and $1,200.98 per month for the Allowance for the Survivor (or about  $12,300 and $14,400 per year respectively, based on July 2015 rates).</p>
<p>In order to qualify for the Allowances, a  person must be 60 to 64 years old and have resided in Canada for at least 10  years after the age of 18.<sup id="fn10-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn10"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>10</a></sup> In addition, a person must be a  low-income widow or widower to qualify for the Allowance for the Survivor, or  the spouse or common-law partner of a recipient of the GIS to qualify for the  Allowance.</p>
<p>Eligibility for the Allowances is also  based on family income. Benefits are reduced by $0.75 for every dollar of other  income until income reaches $2,048 for singles and $4,096 for couples, by $1.00  for every dollar of other income between $2,048 and $4,544 for singles and  $4,096 to $7,648 for couples, and by $0.75 for every dollar of other income  between $4,544 and $9,096 for singles and $7,648 to $9,120 for couples. When  income exceeds these amounts, benefits are then reduced by $0.50 for every  dollar of other income.<sup id="fn11-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn11"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>11</a></sup> This implies that people qualify  for the Allowance for the Survivor with income up to $23,088 per year and up to  $31,680 for the Allowance in July 2015. Senior spouses of 60 to 64 year olds  would still receive GIS benefits with family incomes up to $41,088.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3 id="h2.8-3.4">2.4  Indexation of Old Age Security benefits</h3>
<p>Benefits paid under the OAS program are, by  law, adjusted quarterly (in January, April, July, and October) according to any  change in the cost-of-living, as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI).<sup id="fn12-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn12"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>12</a></sup> The CPI measures, on a monthly basis, the average change in retail prices of a  “basket” of goods and services commonly purchased by Canadian households such  as shelter, food, clothing, and transportation.</p>

<section>
<h2 id="h2.9">3. Data</h2>
<p>The T1 data from the Canada Revenue Agency  (CRA) is used for this paper. The T1 is the form used by individuals to file  their personal income tax return to the CRA. The T1 data include information on  income and demographic characteristics of all individuals who file a tax  return.</p>
<p>For this study, a 10% sample of individuals  who were 60 years of age and older were selected from the T1 data from 2002 to  2014 (8 million observations).<sup id="fn13-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn13"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>13</a></sup> Non-residents were excluded from  the sample, as their income information could be incomplete (non-residents’  income from overseas is not taxable in Canada).<sup id="fn14-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn14"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>14</a></sup></p>
<p>It should be noted that some people do not  file tax returns. <a href="#tbl-01">Table 1</a> examines the coverage  of the T1 file by comparing the number of tax filers in the sample to  population estimates from Statistics Canada among people 60 years of age and  older living in Canada. It is estimated that 97% to 99% of this age group filed  taxes (and are therefore included in the sample), with a slightly higher  percentage among those who were 65 years old and older.</p>

<p>Information on spouses of individuals in  the sample was also added to the sample, allowing the examination of couples’  characteristics (for example, couples’ total income, couples’ income used to  assess GIS benefit amounts, etc.). However, some of the spouses of individuals  in the sample did not file a tax return, especially in earlier years. The  percentage of couples with income information on their spouse increases every  year, from 93% in 2002 to almost 99% in 2014.

<p>The family income used to assess  eligibility for the GIS and the Allowances was estimated, as it is not included  in the database. This estimated family income includes all sources of income (tax  return line 150) from which are subtracted OAS benefits, contributions to  Employment Insurance (EI) and the Canada/Quebec Pension Plan (C/QPP), net  Universal Child Care Benefits (UCCB), Registered Disability Savings Plan (RDSP)  income, the estimated GIS earnings exemption, social assistance payments,  Registered Pension Plan deductions, Registered Retirement Savings Plan deductions,  the Saskatchewan Pension Plan deduction, Pension Income Splitting (tax return line  210), union and professional dues, child care expenses, the Disability Supports  deduction (tax return line 215), allowable business investment loss (tax return  line 217), moving expenses, support payments made (tax return line 220),  carrying charges and interest expenses (tax return line 221), exploration and  development expenses (tax return line 224), other employment expenses (tax  return line 229), the Clergy residence deduction (tax return line 231) and  other deductions (tax return line 232). This corresponds to the income  definition used to calculate GIS and Allowance benefits. However, due to data  limitations, social benefits repayments (tax return line 235, in other words,  OAS Recovery Tax and repayments of EI benefits) were also subtracted from this  estimated income, even though in reality they are not included in the  calculation of GIS eligibility.<sup id="fn16-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn16"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>16</a></sup> Also, net  UCCB payments were not available in the data for years 2006 and 2007.</p>

The  percentage of seniors receiving the OAS pension has been relatively steady  since 2002. However, the percentage of OAS pension recipients who received the  GIS has varied from year to year, decreasing from 40% in 2007 to 35% in 2014. Among  tax filers aged 60 to 64 years old, 4% received the Allowances in 2014. The  proportion of 60 to 64 year-olds receiving the Allowances has steadily decreased  from 7% in 2002 to 4% in 2014.</p>

<h3 id="h2.10-3.1">4.1 Labour market participation of seniors and Old Age  Security beneficiaries</h3>
<p>This section examines the labour market  participation of seniors (65 and over), near-seniors (60 to 64) and OAS program  beneficiaries. More precisely, it examines employment rates, in other words,  the percentage of people with employment income or self-employment revenue in  the year.<sup id="fn19-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn19"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>19</a></sup> Both seniors and near-seniors  provide a significant contribution to the labour market in Canada. In 2014,  there were 1.1 million seniors working and 1.3 million near-seniors that were  working.</p>
<p>Note that this section examines employment  rates rather than labour market participation rates, in other words, the focus  is on the percentage that are working rather than the percentage that are  working or looking for work, as individuals looking for work are not identified  in the data used. Nevertheless, unemployed individuals looking for work  represent a small percentage of this age group.<sup id="fn20-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn20"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>20</a></sup></p>
<section>
<h4>4.1.1 Recent trends in employment rates of seniors</h4>
<p>The employment rate of seniors (65 and over)  has increased by over 50% since 2002, increasing from 12% of seniors in 2002 to  19% in 2014 (<a href="#fig-02">Figure 2</a>), an increase of 7  percentage points. For near-seniors, aged 60 to 64 years old, there is also an  increasing trend. In 2002, 50% of near-seniors were working, and this  proportion reached 60% in 2014, an increase of 10 percentage points.<sup id="fn21-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn21"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>21</a></sup></p>
<p>The employment rates of women and men have  followed similar increasing trends throughout this period, even though  employment rates were higher for men than for women (<a href="#fig-03">Figure  3</a>). Employment rates reached their highest point in 2014 when 14% of  senior women worked and 25% of senior men (65 and over). Among near seniors,  54% of women worked and 66% of men. As shown in the graph, the increase in the  employment rates of senior women and men throughout this period is very similar  (an increase of about 7 percentage points). However, the increase is more  pronounced for near-senior women than men (an increase of 13 percentage points  for women versus 7 percentage points for men).</p>

<h4>4.1.2 Recent trends in employment rates of Old Age  Security program recipients</h4>
<p>OAS pension recipients had employment rates  that are very similar to rates of seniors in general (65 and over), with  employment rates increasing from 12% in 2002 to 18% in 2014 (<a href="#fig-04">Figure 4</a>). However, GIS recipients had much lower  employment rates in comparison. Employment rates nevertheless increased from 5%  in 2002 to 7% in 2014 among GIS recipients.</p>
<p>Allowances recipients also had much lower  employment rates than 60 to 64 year olds in general. The employment rates of  recipients of the Allowances increased by over 50% throughout this period,  increasing from 15% of recipients in 2002 to 24% in 2014. However, this  remained well below the employment rate of near-seniors in general, which  reached 54% for women and 66% for men in 2014.</p>

<p><a href="#fig-05">Figures 5</a> and <a href="#fig-06"> 6</a> show that most of the increase in the employment rate is due to  the proportion of OAS recipients employed by an employer, rather than those  that are self-employed.

<h3 id="h2.10-3.2">4.2 Impact of the increase in  the Guaranteed Income Supplement earnings exemption</h3>
<p>In 2008, the government increased the GIS  earnings exemption to fully exempt the first $3,500 of work income so a “GIS  recipient will be able to keep more of her or his hard-earned money without any  reduction in GIS benefits, encouraging labour market participation and  providing support for low-income seniors.”<sup id="fn23-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn23"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>23</a></sup> Before  2008, only 20% of work income up to $2,500 was exempt (providing a maximum  earnings exemption of $500). These earnings exemptions also apply to  beneficiaries of the Allowances.</p>
<p><a href="#tbl-03">Table 3</a> presents the percentage of recipients of the Allowances and the GIS  who were working for an employer, before and after 2008, and compares them  respectively to other 60 to 64 year old near-seniors and to other OAS pension  recipients. Note that the GIS earnings exemption did not apply to  self-employment income during this period.<sup id="fn24-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn24"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>24</a></sup> Therefore  self-employment is excluded from the analysis of the earnings exemption.<sup id="fn25-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn25"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>25</a></sup></p>

<p>The percentage of Allowances recipients  that were working for an employer increased following the increase in the GIS  earnings exemption in 2008. In particular, this proportion was higher in 2008,  2009 and 2010, than in 2007, before the change.<sup id="fn26-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn26"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>26</a></sup> By  comparison, among other near-seniors (not receiving the Allowances) the  proportion working for an employer stayed relatively constant in 2007, 2008,  2009 and 2010. Comparing these 2 trends reinforces the idea that the increase in  the GIS earnings exemption might have had an effect on employment rates of  recipients of the Allowances. More formal multivariate analysis is conducted  below.</p>
<p>In addition, this policy might also have an  impact on the amount of work done by recipients of the Allowances who choose to  work. <a href="#tbl-04">Table 4</a> shows that the average real employment  income (2014 dollars) of recipients of the Allowances who already worked  increased following the increase in the GIS earnings exemption in 2008, notably  in 2008, 2009 and 2010. However, among other near-seniors (not receiving the  Allowances), average real work income for those who worked continually  decreased from 2007 to 2009. Comparing these 2 trends reinforces the idea that  the policy change might have had an effect on the amount of work as well. Again,  more formal multivariate analysis is conducted below.</p>
<p>For GIS recipients, the results are not as  conclusive. The percentage of GIS recipients working for an employer did not  increase significantly following the increase in the GIS earnings exemption in  2008. In particular, the proportion working in 2007 (before the change) was  similar to the proportion in 2008, 2009 and 2010. However, if we compare this  trend to the one of other OAS pension recipients, among which the proportion  working for an employer continuously increased from 2007 to 2008, 2009 and  2010, it reinforces the idea that the increase in the GIS earnings exemption  might not have had an effect on employment rates of GIS recipients. More formal  analysis using multivariate regression analysis with this  difference-in-difference framework could not be performed, as the 2 groups had  different trends from 2002 to 2007, before the policy change.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, this policy might have an  impact on the amount of work among GIS recipients who chose to work for an  employer. The average real work income (2014 dollars) of GIS recipients who  work increased following the increase in the GIS earnings exemption in 2008,  notably in 2008, 2009 and 2010. However, among other OAS pension recipients,  average real work income for those who worked continually decreased from 2007  to 2011. A comparison of real work earnings from the period before the policy  change (2002 to 2007) to the period afterwards (2008 to 2014) shows average  work earnings increased by 14% among GIS recipients who work, while it declined  by 6% among other OAS pension recipients who work. Comparing these 2 trends  reinforces the idea that the policy change might have had a positive effect on  the amount of work among GIS recipients who work. However, for the same reasons  as above, a more formal multivariate analysis could not be used to measure this  effect.</p>
<p>Note that the existence of the GIS earnings  exemption is likely not known by all GIS and Allowance recipients. If this is  in fact the case, it might also reduce its efficiency to encourage recipients  to work if they wish to. In 2014, 4% of GIS recipients worked for an employer  and only 2% of GIS recipients worked enough to take advantage of the full  amount of the exemption ($3,500). Both these figures increased only slightly  since 2008. Among recipients of the Allowances, 18% worked for an employer and  13% used the full amount of the earnings exemption in 2014.</p>
<section>
<h4>4.2.1 Difference-in-difference framework and results</h4>
<p>The section presents the  difference-in-difference framework used for the multivariate regression  analysis of the impacts of the increase in the GIS earnings exemption on the  labour market participation of recipients of the Allowances. Two outcomes  regarding labour market participation are examined here:</p>
<ul>
<li>the likelihood of being employed (working for an employer), and</li>
<li>the amount of real work earnings (2014 dollars) among those who chose to work</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the GIS earnings exemption does  not apply to self-employment income. Therefore self-employment income is not  taken into account in the following analysis of the earnings exemption, except  when examining robustness of results.</p>
<section>
<h5>Methodology</h5>
<p>The identification strategy used here to  measure the effect of this policy change is a difference-in-difference  framework, where outcomes are compared between a treatment and a control group,  both before and after a program change. This can be illustrated by defining the  effect as a difference between 4 averages of an outcome:</p>
<figure id="equ-01">
<figcaption><strong> Equation 1 – Difference-in-difference calculation</strong></figcaption>
<img alt="Equation 1 – Difference-in-difference calculation" class="img-responsive" src="/content/dam/esdc-edsc/images/services/pension/reports/labour-market-low-income-seniors/equ1-en.png"/>
<details>
<summary>Equation 1 - Text version</summary>
<p>The  effect of the policy change is estimated by subtracting the change in the  control group’s outcome before and after the policy change from the change in  the treatment group’s outcome before and after the policy change. </p>
</details>
</figure>
<div class="clearfix"></div>
<p>To increase the precision and reliability  of the results, effects are measured using regression analysis with this  difference-in-difference framework. In the current paper, the treatment group  is recipients of the Allowances. The program change examined is the increase in  the GIS earnings exemption in 2008. The control group used here is: near-seniors  (60 to 64) not receiving the Allowances that have income other than work above  Allowances thresholds or that are neither widows nor spouses of seniors.<sup id="fn27-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn27"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>27</a></sup> The choice of this control group ensures assignment to the control group is not  affected by the decision to work or not.<sup id="fn28-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn28"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>28</a></sup> </p>
<p>In the following analysis, the effect of  the increase in the GIS earnings exemption in 2008 will be examined graphically  to begin, then examined by comparing averages of different groups before and  after the change, and finally examined using regression analysis with a  difference-in-difference framework.</p>

<p>Regarding the percentages that are  employed, both groups followed similar upward trends before the change in 2008.  In 2009, 2010 and 2011, this proportion continued to increase for recipients of  the Allowances while it stayed relatively constant between 2008 and 2010 in the  control group of other 60 to 64 year old near-seniors.</p>
<p>Regarding average employment earnings among  those that are employed, the trends follow a similar s-shape before 2008. In  2008, 2009 and 2010, average employment earnings increased among recipients of  the Allowances while it remained below its 2007 level among the control group  of other 60 to 64 year old near-seniors.</p>
<p>Overall, these 2 graphs show that these 2  groups were following similar trends before 2008, suggesting that the  comparison group is adequate to examine the effect of this policy using a  difference-in-difference framework. The graphs also suggest that this policy  change might have had an effect. Further analysis below is required to confirm  this.</p>
<p>Note that attempts were made to find a  valid control group to also examine the effect of the increase in the GIS  earnings exemption on GIS recipients. Unfortunately, no valid control group was  found, as all potential control groups followed different trends than GIS  recipients.</p>
<p><a href="#tbl-05">Table 5</a> examines the socio-economic characteristics of the treatment group  and the control group. It shows that there are some significant differences  between treatment and control groups beyond income. Notably, the treatment  group (Allowances recipients) includes a higher percentage of women, a higher  percentage of single people, older people, a lower percentage of people that  are self-employed and a lower percentage of people whose spouse works. These  differences between the control and treatment groups underline the importance  of including these socio-economic characteristics in the regression framework,  to take into account differences between the groups in the analysis.</p>

<h5>Comparing averages before and after the policy change</h5>
<p>Next, <a href="#tbl-06">Table 6</a> examines the percentages of those who worked for an employer and the average  work earnings (2014 dollars) in the treatment and control groups, before and  after the policy change. Differences in averages show that the proportion of  recipients of the Allowances who were employed increased by 4.6 percentage  points from the 2002 to 2007 period to the 2008 to 2014 period (before and  after the policy change). In comparison, the proportion employed increased by  4.5 percentage points in the control group of other 60 to 64 year old  near-seniors. Therefore, comparing these 2 differences, the proportion who  worked among the treatment group increased by 0.1 percentage point more than  among the control group. However, one could argue that because the proportions  among the 2 groups were so different to begin with, we should compare growth  rates (% change) in the proportion employed instead. The proportion of  recipients of the Allowances who were employed increased by 32% from the 2002  to 2007 period to the 2008 to 2014 period. Over the same period,  the proportion in the control group of other  near-seniors who were employed increased by 10%.<sup id="fn29-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn29"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>29</a></sup> Therefore, comparing the 2 growth rates, the growth in the proportion who were  employed in the treatment group was 22 percentage points higher than that in  the control group. These 2 interpretations suggest a positive effect of this  policy change on the proportion of recipients of the Allowances who worked. However,  as discussed above, a regression framework should be used in order to take into  account differences in socio-economic characteristics between the treatment and  control groups.</p>

<h5>Regression results</h5>
<p>As discussed above, a regression framework  should be used to analyze the effect of this policy change. There are 2  hypotheses (Ho) we should test:</p>
<ul>
<li>the increase in the GIS earnings exemption  increased the proportion of recipients of the Allowances who were employed, and</li>
<li>the increase in the GIS earnings exemption  increased employment earnings (2014 dollars) among recipients of the Allowances  who were employed</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="#tbl-07">Table 7</a> presents the main regression results; the effect of the policy  change is presented in the first line. Other variables in the regression include:  an indicator for the group (treatment or control), an indicator for time (pre-  or post-policy change), gender, marital status (single or not), an indicator  for having a spouse aged 65 years and older, an indicator for having a spouse who  works, an indicator for being self-employed, an indicator for living in one of  Canada’s largest urban centers (Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Toronto, Ottawa  and Montreal), indicators for each age between 61 and 64 and indicators for  each province and territory. Indicators for each year (2002 to 2014) were also  added to the regression to take into account the changing economic situation  during this period, notably the recession of 2008 and the ensuing recovery. It  is assumed that the recession had similar effects among the control and  treatment groups, given they were following similar trends beforehand. Income  was not included in the regressions given it was used to select the treatment  and control groups (which are recipients and non-recipients of income-tested  benefits).</p>

<p>Regressions include bootstrapped standard  errors clustered on individuals and dummies for each province/territory and  each year. Note that self-employment income is not taken into account in these  results as it does not qualify for the GIS earnings exemption.</p>
<p>For recipients of the Allowances, the  increase in the GIS earnings exemption increased the proportion that worked for  an employer by 1 percentage point and increased employment earnings by 15%  among those who are employed. Based on average employment earnings among  recipients of the Allowances that worked in the 2002 to 2007 period ($9,306), a  15% increase represents almost $1,400 per year for the average Allowances  recipient that works.</p>

Similar regressions were estimated changing the dependent  variable from a normal form to a natural logarithm (ln) form, restricting the  sample to years before 2011 (using only the first 3 years after the policy  change) and including self-employment in the dependent variable. All results  were of the same sign and all except 1 were statistically significant,  enhancing our confidence in the results presented. Results were also of similar  magnitude in all specifications.</p>

<h2 id="h2.11">5. Conclusions</h2>
<p>This paper used T1 data from the CRA to  examine the labour market impacts of the 2008 increase in the GIS earnings  exemption. The study is one of many lines of evidence being produced for the  evaluation of the OAS program.</p>
<p>This study showed that the increase in the  GIS earnings exemption in 2008 has increased the labour market participation of  recipients of the Allowances. Using a treatment and a control group in a  difference-in-difference regression framework, it was estimated that this  policy change increased employment earnings by 15% among those who work for an  employer and increased the employment rate of recipients of the Allowances by 1  percentage point.</p>
<p>It was not possible to use this regression  framework to examine the effect on GIS recipients. Nevertheless, descriptive  statistics show a similar increase in employment earnings after the increase in  the GIS earnings exemption, among GIS recipients who choose to work.</p>

<p>In practice, the calculation to estimate income used in this paper to  assess eligibility for GIS was: net income (tax return line 236) minus OAS  benefits (tax return lines 113 and 146), net UCCB (tax return lines 117 and  213), RDSP income (tax return line 125), social assistance payments (tax return  line 145), and EI and C/QPP contributions through employment (tax return lines  308, 312 and 317). Provincial Parental Insurance Plan premiums on  self-employment income were added to this, as they are already subtracted in  CRA’s calculations of net income, but these premiums are not taken into account  for GIS eligibility. This calculation is equivalent to what is defined in the  text above.</p>

<p>Note that the T1 data provides an estimate of the number of people  receiving benefits in a year while the published OAS administrative data  provides the monthly average number of people receiving benefits in a year.

<p>According to the Labour Force Survey, 0.6% of seniors aged 65 or older  were unemployed and looking for work in 2014. This figure was higher for  near-seniors aged 60 to 64, at 3.4% in 2014.</p>

<p>Employment rates in the Labour Force Survey (LFS) are lower but show  similar trends. In the LFS, the monthly average employment rate increased from  7% in 2002 to 13% in 2014 among seniors and from 37% to 50% among near-seniors.  The difference in employment rates between the LFS and the T1 data are due to  the different ways to measure employment in each source of data and simply  imply that many people did not work for the whole year. The LFS considers  someone employed if they were employed during the reference week of the survey,  while for the T1 data, employment was determined by the presence of employment  income or self-employment revenue in the year. Also, about 2% of seniors and  near-seniors in the T1 data had very limited attachment to the labour market  with employment earnings between $1 and $1,000 during the year. Employment  rates using T1 data are used here as it is more comprehensive and it enables  the identification of OAS recipients.</p>

<p>Using a revealed preference approach inspired by Kline and Tartari  (2016), we argue that assignment to the treatment group is not affected by the  policy change either. The policy change did not expand the choices of baskets  of leisure, work and family income (including benefits) which exclude  Allowances benefits, in other words, all baskets with zero benefits available  after the policy change were already available before the policy change (all  else equal). Therefore, standard revealed preferences show that an individual  receiving the Allowances before the policy change would not choose a basket  with zero Allowances benefits after the policy change, given these baskets were  already available and not chosen by the individual before the policy change.  Consult Kline and Tatari (2016) for an example of an empirical application of  revealed preferences or a standard microeconomic textbook for an illustration  of revealed preferences (for example Varian, 1995).</p>
