<h2 id="h2.1">Highlights</h2>
<p>This evaluation examined the performance of the Occupational  Health and Safety Program, within the Labour Program of Employment and Social  Development Canada (ESDC). It complies with the 2016 Treasury Board policy on results, and covers the period  from fiscal year 2011 to 2012 and up to fiscal year 2015 to 2016. A fiscal year runs from  April 1 to March 31.</p>
<p>Definitions for terms marked with an asterisk (*)  can be found in Annex A. </p>
<section>
<h3 id="h2.1-3.1">Key findings and recommendations</h3>
<p>This evaluation found that program activities have  contributed to a safe and healthy workplace. For instance, the majority of  surveyed federally regulated employers (91%) and employees (71%) found that  Occupational Health and Safety regulations adequately ensured a safe and  healthy workplace. Key highlights of this evaluation are as follows: </p>
<section>
<h4>Modernization and awareness</h4>
<p>There are emerging challenges in occupational health and  safety, particularly in the areas of mental health and non-standard*  employment, leading to a rise in vulnerable* workers.</p>
<p>Recommendation 1: Increase awareness of occupational health  and safety to address emerging challenges, prevent future issues and risks, and  further support vulnerable workers.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h4>Proactive activities</h4>
<p>As the Disabling injury incidence rate* increased by 7% over  the evaluation period, proactive inspections dropped by 45% and the number of  inspection officers declined. </p>
<p>Recommendation 2: Explore ways to increase proactive  activities, including strategically targeted inspections in high risk sectors,  in order to detect violations and prevent potential injuries and/or illnesses. </p>
</section>
<section>
<h4>Reactive activities</h4>
<p>While all surveyed employers are satisfied with the results  stemming from the internal complaints resolution process, employees are  considerably less satisfied (60%) with the overall process, including the  timeliness of services (55%). </p>
<p>Recommendation 3: Identify and address issues that may have  hindered the effectiveness of the internal complaints resolution process, and  develop service standards to address violations in a timely and effective  manner. </p>
</section>
<section>
<h4>Performance measurement practices</h4>
<p>The performance measurement practices in place do not fully  support the monitoring and measuring of expected outcomes, such as compliance  with the Code and incidence rates in high-risk sectors. </p>
<p>Recommendation 4: To support monitoring and reporting  activities, the program could improve performance measurement practices to  capture reliable information with respect to key metrics, such as incidence rates,  compliance levels, and the severity of violations. </p>

<section>
<h4>Recommendation 1</h4>
<p>Increase  awareness of occupational health and safety to address emerging challenges,  prevent future issues and risks, and further support vulnerable workers.</p>
<p><strong>Response:</strong></p>
<p>The Labour  Program agrees with the recommendation to modernize and increase awareness of  occupational health and safety regulations.</p>
<p>In response to the recommendation of the 2016 Audit of the  OHS Program to develop a strategic  framework for data gathering and analysis to improve program monitoring and  reporting, management created the Business Intelligence Unit and  associated Business Intelligence Strategic Framework to improve data  accessibility and data integrity.</p>
<p>Management  will continue to engage with stakeholders, including employee and employer  representatives, and federal, provincial and territorial jurisdictions by using  established platforms such as the Occupational Health and Safety  Advisory Committee (OHSAC) and the Canadian Association of Administrators of  Labour Legislation - Occupational Health and Safety (CAALL-OHS). </p>
<p><strong>Action  1:</strong></p>
<p>The Labour Program will use various platforms (internal and  external) to consult, monitor, gather information and increase awareness within  the Labour Program of emerging occupational health and safety issues in the  workplace (ongoing).</p>
<p><strong>Action  2:</strong></p>
<p>Establish a Strategic Stakeholder Relations Unit within the  OHS Program to monitor key emerging issues (ongoing).</p>
<p><strong>Action  3:</strong></p>
<p>The Labour Program will create a framework to consolidate  the activities in which the OHS Program participates (March 2019):</p>
<ul>
<li>having technical experts attend international  conferences in order to remain up to date with international issues and  practices</li>
<li>participating in an artificial intelligence  pilot project, and</li>
<li>OHS regulatory harmonization</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Action  4:</strong></p>
<p>The Labour Program will develop a proposal to establish a  prevention approach to occupational health and safety issues (November 2019).</p>
<p>This proposal will determine the best approach to  anticipating the occupational health and safety risks that exist specifically  for vulnerable workers.</p>

<h4>Recommendation 2</h4>
<p>Explore  ways to increase proactive activities, including strategically targeted  inspections in high risk sectors, in order to detect violations and prevent  potential injuries and/or illnesses.</p>
<p><strong>Response:</strong></p>
<p>The Labour  Program agrees with the recommendation to increase proactive activities,  including strategically targeted inspections in high-risk sectors.</p>
<p><strong>Action  1:</strong></p>
<p>The Program  is conducting research on prevention to determine ways to improve its proactive  activities, particularly in high-risk sectors such as transport (March 2020).</p>
<p><strong>Action  2:</strong></p>
<p>The Program  is conducting a pilot project using data from workers compensation boards in  Saskatchewan to gather information on where proactive activities should be  targeted (Start date: January 2019).</p>
<p><strong>Action  3:</strong></p>
<p>A pilot  project is underway in the Quebec and the Central regions to test the  re-allocation of inspections using a new targeting tool to address prevention  (March 2020).</p>

<section>
<h4>Recommendation 3</h4>
<p>Identify  and address issues that may have hindered the effectiveness of the internal  complaint resolution process, and develop service standards to address  violations in a timely and effective manner.</p>
<p><strong>Response:</strong></p>
<p>The Labour Program agrees with the recommendation to  identify and address issues with the Internal Complaint Resolution Process and  develop service standards.</p>
<p>In response to the 2016 Audit of the OHS Program recommendation  to develop a comprehensive service  delivery strategy to formalize regular activities and interactions with clients  and stakeholders, management developed Client Service Delivery Standards  and a Client/Stakeholder Engagement Strategy.</p>
<p><strong>Action  1:</strong></p>
<p>The Labour program will produce a report examining the  reasons as to why there is sometimes failure to achieve consensus within the  workplace on refusal to work cases by consulting with stakeholders (May 2019).</p>
<p><strong>Action  2:</strong></p>
<p>The Program will conduct an analysis on ways in which health  and safety officers (HSO) can better help workplace parties throughout the  course of the internal complaint resolution process (September 2019). The  Program will then develop more tools and guidance documents for use by HSOs.</p>
<p><strong>Action  3:</strong></p>
<p>The Labour Program developed and published service standards<sup id="fn1-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn1"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>1</a></sup> associated with specific  processes in November 2018, in order to reduce employee dissatisfaction with  the length of time in which their complaint was resolved. </p>
<p>The outcome and efficiency resulting from the implementation  of the service standards is expected to be determined further to the strategic  operational planning and yearly cycle reviews. Conducting systematic follow-ups  and reviews of service standards and their outcomes will help identify areas in  which improvements or other service standards can be implemented, in order to  better respond to issues or concerns of clients and further reduce employee  dissatisfaction (ongoing).</p>

<h4>Recommendation 4</h4>
<p>To support  monitoring and reporting activities, the program could improve performance  measurement practices to capture reliable information with respect to key  metrics, such as incidence rates, compliance levels, and the severity of violations.</p>
<p><strong>Response:</strong></p>
<p>The Labour  Program agrees with the recommendation to improve performance measurement  practices.</p>
<p>In response to the 2016 Audit of the OHS Program  recommendation to develop a  program-wide quality control process, including indicators to measure the  on-going effectiveness of key OHS processes, management developed a quality  control framework that is supported by an overarching OHS performance  measurement framework.</p>
<p>Over the  past 2 years, the Program has worked to examine processes and expected  outcomes and, as part of TBS’ annual Performance Information Profile, develop a  number of performance indicators by which to measure the effectiveness of its  activities, as well as areas where improvements could be made. </p>
<p><strong>Action  1:</strong></p>
<p>The Program will continue to update the annual Performance  Information Profile and track changes in incidence and compliance rates  (ongoing).</p>
<p><strong>Action  2:</strong></p>
<p>The Program will continue to assess its expected outcomes  and indicators on an annual basis, and implement adjustments based on  legislative and regulatory changes (such as is currently being conducted for  harassment and violence prevention) (ongoing).</p>

<section>
<h3 id="h2.3-3.1">Program</h3>
<p>The Occupational Health and Safety Program (“the Program”)  is administered by the Labour Program in Employment and Social Development  Canada and is composed of the Workplace Directorate,<sup id="fn2-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn2"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>2</a></sup> and the Regional  Operations and Compliance Directorate.<sup id="fn3-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn3"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>3</a></sup> </p>
<p>The Program enforces the occupational health and safety  provisions under Part II of the <em>Canada Labour Code </em>for federally  regulated* workplaces.</p>
<p>The Program strives to ensure safe and healthy workplaces  for all federal jurisdiction employees by preventing or reducing the incidence  of work-related injuries and fatalities in federal jurisdiction workplaces.  This is done through awareness of health and safety issues and assisting  employers and employees understand their duties and rights.<sup id="fn4-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn4"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>4</a></sup></p>
<p>The Program’s logic model in Annex B outlines its  activities, outputs, and expected outcomes. </p>
<p>The average annual program spending between fiscal year 2011 to 2012  and fiscal year 2015 to 2016 was $16.8 million.<sup id="fn5-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn5"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>5</a></sup> See Annex C for more  information about the program and a breakdown of program spending. </p>

<h3 id="h2.3-3.2">Evaluation</h3>
<p>The evaluation assessed the Program’s performance by  examining its: </p>
<ul>
<li>emerging issues and challenges</li>
<li>proactive and reactive activities</li>
<li>implementation of changes to Part II of the <em>Canada  Labour Code</em>, and</li>

<h2 id="h2.5">Key findings</h2>
<section>
<h3 id="h2.5-3.1">Modernize regulations and support vulnerable  employees</h3>
<section>
<h4>The Program is working towards updating and  modernizing regulations to reflect the changing nature of the workplace</h4>
<p>Most advanced economies lack the capacity in their  management of Occupational Health and Safety or its regulatory system to  address emerging issues arising from precarious, casual, and temporary  employment* (<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/j.1744-7941.2011.00014.x">Gallagher, 2012</a>).</p>
<ul>
<li>Between  1997 and 2017, the proportion of temporary workers increased by 2.2 percentage  points to reach 11.6%, or 2.1 million of the total workforce* in Canada.<sup id="fn6-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn6"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>6</a></sup></li>
<li>Contract  employment experienced the biggest rise as a form of temporary employment,  growing by almost 97% in the same period.<sup id="fn7-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn7"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>7</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<p>Mental health in the workplace was also identified as an  issue that has emerged.</p>
<ul>
<li>Employer and employee interviewees reported  becoming increasingly aware of mental health issues in the workplace, including  its intersection with drugs, alcohol, and violence.</li>
<li>Employers reported concerns regarding mental  health issues in the workplace, including the scope of their responsibility,  the challenges in investigating and capturing information, and the need for  expertise and specialized services.</li>
</ul>
<p>Employer interviewees noted that the rise in technology is  increasing the risk of potential health issues.</p>
<ul>
<li>Program officials noted that violations related  to handling hazardous materials were frequent, and employers noted the need for  improvements to address technical  issues.</li>
</ul>
<p>The program has a number of tools to address emerging  issues, such as providing website information on stress, violence and bullying;  consulting with the tripartite Occupational Health and Safety Advisory Council;  maintaining contact with field staff regarding emerging issues on the ground;  and leveraging research conducted by the Canadian Centre for Occupational  Health and Safety.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section>
<h3 id="h2.5-3.2">Gender-based analysis plus</h3>
<section>
<h4>The Program collects limited gender-based plus  information on vulnerable employees in both temporary and permanent employment  situations</h4>
<p>Disaggregated employee-related information, by type of  employment, and other key areas such as gender and representation (for example,  disability, minorities), is not collected by the Program.<sup id="fn8-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn8"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>8</a></sup> This information could  support the monitoring and reporting of information that could support  strategic decision-making.</p>
<p>Gender-based information in the 2015 Federal Jurisdiction  Workplace Survey indicates that 19% of women and 11% of men in federally  regulated workplaces are part-time employees.<sup id="fn9-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn9"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>9</a></sup></p>
<p>A survey  conducted by Statistics Canada in 2017 found that women represented almost 52%  of temporary workers in Canada. This proportion has been fairly consistent  since 1997.</p>
<p>Between  1997 and 2017, the growth of women representation in temporary employment* was  almost 75%, as compared to men at almost 59%.</p>
<p>Interviewees noted a need for greater Program support  regarding emerging issues related to the more vulnerable* groups, such as  protection for employees hired by human resource agencies, and employer safety  compliance within non-traditional  work arrangements, such as telework. </p>
</section>
</section>
<section>
<h3 id="h2.5-3.3">Legislation</h3>
<section>
<h4>The program has implemented several legislative  changes, however, there is an indication that further training is needed to  ensure a clear understanding of certain notions in the Code</h4>
<p>During the evaluation period, the  majority of the refusal of dangerous work cases were found to present no  danger.</p>
<p>Employers noted that it may be  unclear to employees what constitutes a danger-related complaint.<sup id="fn10-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn10"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>10</a></sup></p>
<p>Employees indicated that Labour  Program inspection officers’ training was insufficient, which resulted in them  not always being able to identify complex dangers or hazards.<sup id="fn11-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn11"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>11</a></sup></p>
<p>In 2014, the definition of ‘danger’* was amended to:</p>
<ul>
<li>clarify its intended use for employers and  employees</li>
<li>channel non-dangerous cases through their applicable  mechanisms, and</li>
<li>encourage the use of the internal responsibility  system* and the Hazard Prevention Program*</li>
</ul>
<p>In fiscal year 2015 to 2016, the  number of refusal of dangerous work cases reaching the Program decreased by  73%.<sup id="fn12-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn12"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>12</a></sup></p>
<p>The Program does not collect data  that could identify the cause for this drop nor track the cases managed through  the internal responsibility system.</p>

<h3 id="h2.5-3.6">Disabling injury incidence rate</h3>
<section>
<h4>The federal jurisdiction has achieved success in  reducing its disabling injury incidence rate, but it still lags behind some  provincial levels</h4>
<p>During the evaluation period,  the Disabling injury incidence rate* was a key program indicator that measured  safety levels in federally regulated* workplaces.<sup id="fn16-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn16"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>16</a></sup> Between 2011 and 2015, the 2% annual reduction target for this Rate was only  achieved in 2013. </p>

<li>the  Program dedicated an average of 57% of all assignment hours towards  proactive activities, thereby missing its  annual target of spending 80% of its assignment hours on proactive work;  and</li>
<li>the relative number of inspections amongst the  lowest compliant sectors was inconsistent over the evaluation period, thereby  potentially skewing the calculated number of violations found. </li>
</ul>
<p>As well, there was generally an inadequate number of Program officers  available to undertake compliance and enforcement activities, particularly  proactive inspections.<sup id="fn24-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn24"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>24</a></sup></p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>As indicated in  Table 1, the Program did less proactive inspections by the end of the  evaluation period, but found more violations during each inspection.<sup id="fn26-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn26"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>26</a></sup></p>

<section>
<h4>The internal complaint resolution process does not  sufficiently support some employees’ needs</h4>
<p>Employees can  initiate the internal complaint resolution process* where they perceive a  situation is non-dangerous, or dangerous if it were ever carried out. Unlike a  Refuse to Work situation, the employee continues to work, while collaborating  with their employer to seek a resolution to the matter.</p>
<p>The complaints process has been an effective mechanism for identifying  violations, with a possible 79% of complaints over the evaluation period  resulting in a violation.<sup id="fn30-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn30"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>30</a></sup> </p>
<p>As shown in Table 2,  the evaluation survey found that most employees who had made an Occupational  Health and Safety complaint were unsatisfied with various aspects of the complaint  process.<sup id="fn31-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn31"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>31</a></sup> For example, while all employers believed their organization had made changes  based on a complaint, 66% of employees said that changes were not made.</p>

<h4>The Program data collection  systems need improvement to more accurately capture its client universe, and to  support performance measurement</h4>
<section>
<h5>Data collection and reporting</h5>
<p>The Program’s database of employers contains information on  those who make themselves known to the Program.<sup id="fn32-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn32"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>32</a></sup>  As a result, some employers do not receive  program services such as inspections, and some employers and employees are not  aware Program consultation processes and educational material developed.  </p>
<p>In order to improve data integrity, the Program has  identified the need to improve the employers’ compliance with their legislative  requirement to annually report on hazardous occurrences, as a priority.<sup id="fn33-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn33"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>33</a></sup></p>
<p>A 2017 Employment and Social Development Canada Innovation  Lab study and evaluation interviews found the report used to collect annual  injury data requires core modifications, such as a simpler format and clearer  instructions, in order to improve the response rate.

<h4>Information gaps in  measuring program performance limit the Program’s ability to effectively  support and improve employer compliance</h4>
<section>
<h5>Gaps in measuring program performance</h5>
<p>The Program’s ability to conduct certain program activities  (for example, monitoring program  performance, strategically planning for proactive and reactive  activities, and raising awareness to employers and employees) is limited due to  the lack of information on the complete employer universe.</p>
<p>The Disabling Injury Incidence Rate, a Key Performance  Indicator utilized during the evaluation period, is used to inform the  strategic planning of inspections for high risk sectors. The results for each  year of the evaluation are considered representative of the Disabling Injury  Incidence Rate in the federal jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Internal Audit noted the Program’s limited capacity to  measure and report on its performance with the current set of indicators, such  as the Disabling Injury Incidence Rate*. This indicator is not considered to be  a predictive indicator.<sup id="fn36-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn36"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>36</a></sup> </p>
<p>In addition, the following information was not available for  this evaluation or was incomplete. </p>

<h2 id="h2.6">Recommendations</h2>
<p>The program continues to make significant progress in  establishing and protecting federally regulated employees’ rights to a safe and  healthy work environment. In order to further support the achievement of  program outcomes, the following recommendations are offered: </p>
<p><strong>Recommendation  1:</strong> Increase awareness of occupational health and safety to  address emerging challenges, prevent future issues and risks, and further  support vulnerable workers.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation  2:</strong> Explore ways to increase proactive activities, including  strategically targeted inspections in high risk sectors, in order to detect  violations and prevent potential injuries and/or illnesses. </p>
<p><strong>Recommendation  3:</strong> Identify and address issues that may have hindered the  effectiveness of the internal complaints resolution process, and develop  service standards to address violations in a timely and effective manner. </p>
<p><strong>Recommendation  4:</strong> To support monitoring and reporting activities, the program  could improve performance measurement practices to capture reliable information  with respect to key metrics, such as incidence rates, compliance levels, and  the severity of violations. </p>

<section>
<h3 id="h2.7-3.1">Annex A -  Definitions </h3>
<dl>
<dt>Assurance of  voluntary compliance:</dt>
<dd>A written commitment by an employer or employee to  correct a contravention related to a non-dangerous situation within a  specified time. Employers and employees are required to inform the Program of  their corrective action taken to address the Assurance of voluntary compliance.</dd>
<dt>Contract employment:</dt>
<dd>Statistics Canada defines this form of temporary employment, which  includes temporary help agency work, as having a termination date.</dd>
<dt>Danger (pre October  2014):</dt>
<dd>Any existing or  potential hazard or condition or any current or future activity that  could reasonably be expected to cause  injury or illness to a person exposed to it before the hazard or  condition can be corrected, or the activity altered, whether or not the injury  or illness occurs immediately after the exposure to the hazard, condition or  activity, and includes any exposure to a hazardous substance that is likely to  result in a chronic illness, in disease or in damage to the reproductive  system.</dd>
<dt>Danger (post October  2014):</dt>
<dd>Any hazard, condition or activity that could reasonably be  expected to be an imminent or serious  threat to the life or health of a person exposed to it before the hazard  or condition can be corrected or the activity altered [Subsection 122(1)].  </dd>
<dt>Direction:</dt>
<dd>A  formal written order directing an employer or employee to correct a  contravention within a specified period. Issued during inspections or  investigations, where either the Assurance of voluntary compliance was  unaddressed or the situation is deemed dangerous<em>. </em></dd>
<dt>Disabling injury incidence  rate:</dt>
<dd>the total number of disabling and fatal occupational injuries per  100 employees, expressed as full-time equivalents (FTEs). It is calculated by  taking the sum of the total number of disabling and fatal injuries on the job  divided by the total number of FTEs and multiplied by 100.</dd>
<dt>Extended  jurisdiction:</dt>
<dd>Extended jurisdiction partners to Employment and Social  Development Canada (for example, a Transport Canada official responsible for  air or rail safety) to whom the Minister of Labour has delegated his/ her  powers, duties and functions to administer Part II of the <em>Canada Labour Code</em>.</dd>
<dt>Federal inspection  officers:</dt>
<dd>Beyond those employed by the Labour Program, this includes  officers from the National Energy Board and Transport Canada. </dd>
<dt>Federally regulated  employers under Part II of the <em>Canada Labour Code</em>:</dt>
<dd>Applies to  interprovincial and international industries, and includes workplaces in the  private and public sectors, including crown corporations. See Annex G for  details. </dd>
<dt>Hazardous Prevention  Program:</dt>
<dd>Part XIX of the <em>Regulations, entitled Hazard Prevention  Program</em>, covers obligations concerning the identification of hazards, the  assessment of those hazards, the choice of preventive measures, and employee  education.</dd>
<dt>Internal complaint  resolution process:</dt>

The process  allows for the resolution of work place health and safety issues in a more  timely and efficient manner and reinforces the concept of the internal  responsibility system.</dd>
<dt>Internal responsibility system:</dt>
<dd>An underlying philosophy of occupational health and safety legislation  in Canada. All workplace parties are responsible for health and safety at their  work place; employers, in consultation with workplace parties are required to  implement measures and control procedures that are appropriate for their  individual workplaces. The System is supported by Health and Safety  Representatives in workplaces with less than 19 employees, by Workplace  Committees in workplaces with more than 20 employees, and by Policy Committees  in work places with more than 300 employees. </dd>
<dt>Non-standard  employment:</dt>
<dd>Can consist of  part-time or temporary work, or self-employment (<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/27734687?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents" rel="external">Chaykowski,  R.,</a> 2008). </dd>
<dt>Prosecution:</dt>
<dd> Court proceedings based upon non-compliance with provisions of the Canada  Labour Code, Part II. Usually pursued as a result of serious contravention or  when a Direction has not been addressed.

<summary>Annex C - Text version</summary>
<p>The  continuum of proactive to reactive measures applied to align an employer’s  compliance with Part II of the <em>Canada  Labour Code</em> consists of four steps.</p>
<p>A  large arrow from left to right indicates that as employers move right through  the four steps of the continuum, the measures evolve from those that apply  voluntary compliance to those that apply legal enforcement. </p>
<p>Step  1 is education and awareness raising of rights and obligations</p>
<p>Step  2 is Assurance of voluntary compliance</p>
<p>Step  3 is Directions (appeals to appeals officers), injunctions, and recourse  against reprisals</p>
<p>Step  4 is Prosecution (imprisonment and/or fines), naming of offenders (corporations  only) </p>

<h3 id="h2.7-3.5">Annex E - Lines of evidence: descriptions and limitations</h3>
<p>The five lines of evidence are the literature review, the document review, administrative data review, key informant interviews, and a survey of employers and employees. Each line of evidence includes a description and its limitations.</p>
<section>
<h4>Literature review</h4>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> An  examination of Occupational Health and Safety issues during the evaluation  period, as well as recent issues and emerging issues (external documents,  studies). </p>
<p><strong>Limitation:</strong> There  was a limited amount of literature related directly to the federal Occupational  Health and Safety program.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h4>Document review</h4>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> An  analysis of internal Government of Canada, Employment and Social Development  Canada documents, during the evaluation period, to better understand program  activities.</p>
<p><strong>Limitation:</strong>  There may be a gap in the information  available, given that the document review was solely based on readily available  documents. Some internal, unpublished Labour Program documents or studies were  difficult to obtain.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h4>Administrative data review</h4>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> An  analysis of administrative data from the Labour Program’s Labour Application  2000 database was conducted. </p>
<p><strong>Limitation:</strong> The  evaluation team (including contractors) did not have direct access to the  Labour Application 2000 database therefore, the data analysis may not be  comprehensive.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h4>Key informant interviews</h4>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Interviews were conducted with 57 key informants, within 6 groups: program  officials, labour law experts, employer and employee representatives, extended  jurisdiction* partners and provincial labour officials.</p>
<p><strong>Limitation:</strong> The  views of key informants are subject to biases. Additionally, the limited sample  of respondents may not be representative of the views of other non-respondents.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h4>Survey of employers and employees</h4>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> 344  employers and 140 employees responded to the surveys. The surveys assessed  aspects, such as satisfaction with program services, understanding of  procedures, and awareness of proactive activities.</p>
<p><strong>Limitation:</strong> Employers  and employees known to be federally regulated, with available contact  information, were included. The initial target was 650 for both surveys. Only  344 out of 6,100 employers responded to the survey. Only 140 of nearly 3,000  employees responded. Therefore, the sample is not fully representative of  employees and employers in the federal jurisdiction.</p>

<p>The three employee rights under Part  II of the <em>Canada Labour Code</em>:</p>
<ol>
<li>the  Right to know: Employees have  the right to be informed of known or foreseeable hazards in the work place and  to be provided with the information, instruction, training and supervision  necessary to protect their health and safety; </li>
<li>the  Right to participate: As health  and safety representatives or committee members, employees have the right and  the responsibility to participate in identifying and correcting job-related  health and safety concerns through an internal complaint resolution* process;  and</li>
<li>the  Right to refuse dangerous work: If  the person has reasonable cause to believe that a condition exists at work that  presents a danger to himself or herself; the use or operation of a machine or  thing presents a danger to the employee or a co-worker; and the performance of  an activity constitutes a danger to the employee or to another employee. </li>

<h3 id="h2.7-3.8">Annex H - Provincial, territorial and federal average  injury rates</h3>
<p>The Disabling injury incidence rate* (federal) is the  combined rate of disabling and fatal injuries that occurred in federal  jurisdictional workplaces. This rate indicates that, as an annual average over  the 2011 to 2015 period, there were 1.76 full-time equivalents for every 100  full-time equivalents working under the federal jurisdiction that experienced  either a disabling injury or fatality. </p>
<p>The provincial and territorial average time-loss work injury  rates count only disabling injuries, also known as time-loss injury rates. </p>
