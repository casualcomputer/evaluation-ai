<h2> <span id="P19_439"> </span>Executive Summary</h2>
<p><strong>Background:</strong> The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) prepares annual Administered Activities Financial Statements for the reporting of tax revenues using full accrual accounting. As in prior years, the Finance and Administration Branch (F&amp;A) requested Internal Audit Division's (IAD) assistance in providing assurance to management on the accuracy and completeness of selected financial information to be reported in these statements.</p> <p>The work was carried out in conjunction with the annual audit of the financial statements conducted by the Office of the Auditor General (OAG) who is responsible for issuing an audit opinion on their fair presentation. IAD efforts were focused on four areas that were considered at risk for the 2005-2006 fiscal year. The audit approach and methodology for the year-end work was discussed with F&amp;A and the OAG and the IAD results have been used by the OAG in formulating its opinion on the CRA Administered Activities Financial Statements.</p> <p><strong>Objective:</strong> The objective of the audit was to provide assurance to management on the completeness and accuracy of selected cash and Revenue Ledger (RL) procedures and account information and the adequacy of procedures used in estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts (ADA). The scope of the audit did not include the verification of amounts that would appear in the financial statements, but focused on risks that had direct implications on the:</p> <ol>
<li>accuracy and completeness of the newly automated year-end trial balance procedures implemented in the Revenue Ledger (RL);</li>
<li>accuracy and completeness of the separation of the CRA and Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) accounts in the RL;</li>
<li>adequacy of the procedures applied in determining the proportion of uncollectable accounts receivable (ADA rates); and</li>
<li>accuracy of the allocation of cash to the proper fiscal year</li>
</ol> <p>The audit took place between February and September 2006 and was conducted in accordance with the <em>International Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing.</em> </p> <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> <span id="P33_2489"> </span>Overall, the financial reporting procedures and information relating to the areas examined by IAD were found to be accurate and complete in all material respects. However, further management action is needed with respect to completing the separation of the CRA and CBSA RL accounts and some procedural issues have to be addressed with regard to the review process used in estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts (ADA).</p> <p><strong>Action Plans:</strong> CBSA is working towards creating its own RL by December 2007, which would allow for the complete separation of the RL accounts. A working group with representatives from F&amp;A, Tax Services and Debt Management Branch (TSDMB), the Department of Finance and Treasury Board was also set up in September 2006 to discuss ways in which the ADA procedures can be streamlined for the 2006-2007 fiscal year-end processes.</p>

<h3> <span id="P59_5687"> </span>1.0 Automation of the Trial Balance in the Revenue Ledger (RL)</h3>
<p>The trial balance used by F&amp;A as the basis for the preparation of the administered financial statements has in the past been generated manually using a spreadsheet. Effective April 1, 2006, F&amp;A introduced automated procedures for preparing this year-end trial balance within RL itself.</p> <p>IAD reviewed the new automated procedures used for posting the accrual and adjustment entries into RL and confirmed the accuracy of the postings. The automation did not extend to the actual determination of the entries and for that reason these manual processes did not fall within the scope of this audit.</p> <p>Further details are provided in Table 1 below regarding the key risks considered in reviewing the new RL automated procedures, audit testing carried out and the results.</p>

<h3> <span id="P80_7379"> </span>2.0 Separation of the CRA and CBSA Accounts in the RL</h3>
<p>CRA and the CBSA became separate organizations in 2004 but they have continued to share accounts for recording of revenues in the RL. Financial reporting for both organizations has become time-consuming and complex under this arrangement. Efforts were made in 2005-2006 to separate the shared accounts to the extent practical given the technical limitations of having to still share the Revenue Ledger system.</p> <p>At the time the audit began, F&amp;A indicated that the separation had not been completed for 24 RL accounts as CRA and CBSA still share the same client Department Number (122) for reporting cash and interdepartmental settlements to Public Works and Government Services Canada (PWGSC).</p> <p>IAD confirmed that work on separating the CRA and CBSA accounts in RL had been undertaken. However, further work is still required to complete the process and manual entries were used to separate transactions in preparing the trial balances again this year. Complete separation will be dependent upon CBSA implementing its own accounting system.</p> <p>Further details are provided in Table 2 below regarding key risks considered in reviewing CRA and CBSA accounts in the RL, audit testing carried out and the results.</p>

<td>IAD review of all RL accounts (approximately 3000) confirmed that the 24 accounts identified by F&amp;A with both CRA and CBSA system interfaces had been appropriately flagged as being shared.Two other accounts were identified with material balances that had both CRA and CBSA system interfaces. F&amp;A, however, did separate transactions in these accounts in preparing the trial balance for year-end.Manual intervention by F&amp;A was required to separate transactions in RL so that each Agency was able to prepare their respective trial balances.Ongoing use of CRA systems by CBSA for its revenue recording, cash receipts, disbursements and accounting is an ongoing impediment to achieving complete account separation. Until this occurs, manual intervention will continue to be needed to separate the transactions for financial reporting purposes.</td>

<h3> <span id="P118_11816"> </span>3.0 Allowance for Doubtful Accounts (ADA)</h3>
<p>The allowance for doubtful accounts is established to indicate management's best estimate of the collectability of amounts assessed but not yet paid. The ADA is calculated by CRA on the basis of an annual evaluation of the collectability of a sample of accounts receivable by experienced collections personnel (ADA analysts).</p> <p>The F&amp;A Branch requested an increase in the sample size for this year to provide added precision in establishing ADA estimates within each revenue stream. Regional ADA analysts under the direction of the Tax Services and Debt Management Branch (TSDM) conducted the sample review at three CRA locations. Account review procedures and guidelines as well as an MS Access software program were developed for use by the field officers to ensure consistency in evaluating the collectability of the accounts receivable. The software program required officers to follow a prescribed approach in evaluating each account.</p> <p>After the initial evaluation of the accounts was completed, concerns were raised about a possible understatement of the ADA because of an unintentional bias in the results. For that reason a secondary review of the same sample of accounts was undertaken. This resulted in an increase in the ADA estimate and this final amount was subsequently accepted by the OAG. The decision to carry out additional work this year serves to underscore an inherent risk associated with the current methodology (using sampling) in terms of producing inconsistent results.</p> <p>Further details are provided in Table 3 below regarding the key risks considered in reviewing the ADA review process, the audit testing carried out and the results.</p>

<h3> <span id="P166_17282"> </span>4.0 Allocation of Cash Receipts</h3>
<p>The allocation of cash to the proper fiscal year is an important element in determining the amount of cash reported on the Administered Activities Financial Statements.

<td>Inaccurate dates are used to allocate cash receipts to the proper fiscal year.</td>
<td>A judgement sample of 338 payments received in March and April 2006 was selected for verification from various revenue streams processed at four field offices and the Ottawa Technology Centre (OTC).</td>
<td>Allocation of cash to the proper fiscal year is done using the payment-received date recorded in the CRA client accounting systems. IAD found the date recorded in the system was not correct in 13 out of the 338 samples selected for review, or 3.8% of the sampled population. (There was a difference of between 1-3 days in the date recorded for 12 payments and for 1 it was 30 days.)Only 4 of the 13 errors identified affected the cash allocation to the incorrect fiscal year. IAD estimated that cash on hand was understated by approximately $32 million, which was below the materiality threshold used for this audit ($500 million).Of the remaining 9 errors, 7 were attributed to the CRA payment system (FIP) not functioning during the period of April 2- April 5, 2006.FI-remitted payments were identified as having a high error rate last year but only one of the errors found this year was this type of payment. This can largely be attributed to action taken by management to increase verification of date information at the OTC.</td>

<h2> <span id="P190_19749"> </span>Follow Up of 2004-2005 Fiscal Year-End Audit</h2>
<p>IAD followed up on findings in the previous fiscal year-end audit to determine the status of management actions plans. The two areas in which recommendations had been made included the allocation of cash receipts and the allowance for doubtful accounts and action taken to address the issues identified can be found in the sections of this report relating to these areas.</p>

<h2> <span id="P192_20165"> </span>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Overall, the financial reporting procedures and information relating to the areas examined by IAD were found to be accurate and complete in all material respects. However, further management action is needed with respect to completing the separation of the CRA and CBSA RL accounts and some procedural issues have to be addressed with regard to the review process used in estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts (ADA). CBSA is working towards creating its own RL by December 2007, which would allow for the complete separation of the RL accounts. A working group with representatives from F&amp;A, Tax Services and Debt Management Branch (TSDMB), the Department of Finance and Treasury Board was also set up in September 2006 to discuss ways in which the ADA procedures can be streamlined for the 2006-2007 fiscal year-end processes.</p>
