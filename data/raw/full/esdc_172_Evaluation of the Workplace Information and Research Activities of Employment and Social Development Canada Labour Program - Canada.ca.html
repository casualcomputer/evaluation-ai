<p>The Workplace Information and Research Division<sup id="fn1-rf">
<a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn1">
<span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>1</a>
</sup> of ESDC’s Labour Program is responsible for the management of the Workplace Information and Research Activities (WIRA) of the Labour Program. These activities include the collection, analysis and provision of information on collective agreements to various users, including collective agreement negotiating parties in Canada. As part of its activities, the division also conducts other related research activities for internal, as well as external users to inform labour policy development, program reviews and other decision-making processes.<sup id="fn2-rf">
<a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn2">
<span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>2</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p>During 2010-2011 to 2012-2013, the division underwent significant organizational changes to its publication and data collection processes as part of the Business Process Redesign.<sup id="fn3-rf">
<a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn3">
<span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>3</a>
</sup> Those changes prompted the Labour Program to request an evaluation of their impacts on the effectiveness and efficiency of WIRA. This is the first evaluation of the Labour Program’s information and research activities. </p>
<p>The main objectives of the evaluation were to assess the impacts of the Business Process Redesign changes and the relevance, continued need, and the effectiveness and efficiency of WIRA operations. The evaluation is unique in that it provides evidence on the quality of activities, users’ satisfaction and efficiency of the WIRA operations as a federal departmental service to its users, both internal and external, rather than as a traditional program with immediate and long-term outcomes. This report presents the findings and recommendations of the WIRA evaluation covering the period from 2008 to 2013.</p>
<p>Evaluation data collection activities took place between September and December 2014. Appendix B provides a detailed description of the methodologies used, and their strengths and limitations. </p>
<h3>Key findings </h3>
<ul>
<li>Continued need: The evaluation confirmed that WIRA products and services are used by a wide range of both internal and external users and known and unknown users. Users of WIRA products and services reported they use the products to plan, negotiate and settle collective agreements, as well as labour disputes. They also use them to conduct research in the area of labour relations. WIRA research products are used to develop policies and support decision making processes. The division contributes to ESDC’s mandate relating to the collection, analysis and dissemination of data and information on labour matters in both federal and provincial labour jurisdictions, as well as its international reporting obligations. Users reported that they will likely use WIRA products in the future and that their demand will increase, although some users indicated that new products or a broadened scope of existing products and improved accessibility are needed. </li>
<li>Alignment of WIRA with ESDC mandate: WIRA products and services contribute to ESDC’s Strategic Outcome 2: “Safe, fair and productive workplaces and cooperative workplace relations.” By supporting negotiating parties in settling collective agreements, WIRA products contribute to fair and cooperative workplace relations. The Treasury Board Secretariat (TBS), Statistics Canada, and the Bank of Canada use WIRA products and services to prepare briefing notes and policy options for senior management to support decision making. For example, economic impact analyses, conducted by the division, help the Government decide on proposed amendments to the <em>Canada Labour Code</em>. </li>
<li>The Workplace Information and Research Division is the unique national source of information on collective agreements: The division maintains information on collective agreements in federal and provincial jurisdictions. Thus, the division is the only source of information on collective agreements with a national focus. Provinces and territories, as well as major unions maintain and provide information on collective agreements, but only for their respective jurisdictions. In addition, some WIRA products, such as information on union membership and affiliation, and work stoppages at the national level are unique to the division. </li>
<li>The Workplace Information and Research Division needs to better match its products to users’ needs to be efficient in its operations: The Performance Measurement Strategy (PM Strategy) for WIRA noted that the division produces and makes its products available on its website but does not actively promote them. The PM Strategy recommended that the division collect performance data to better understand and meet users’ needs efficiently. The document review suggests documenting and describing the theory of change<sup id="fn4-rf">
<a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn4">
<span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>4</a>
</sup> underlying WIRA to understand the causal link between its activities and outputs or outcomes to ensure that better performance measures are selected and appropriate performance information/data are collected. Accurate user contact information and regular communication to seek users’ feedback on the quality of products and services provided are necessary to match products with users’ needs. </li>
<li>The Workplace Information and Research Division is effective in making high quality products and services easily accessible to its users: Most users indicated that the access to WIRA products and services is easy and that they received help from the division easily and quickly. However, navigability of Negotech, the repository of all collective agreements, and the division website and awareness of new products were highlighted by some users as challenges to accessing WIRA products. WIRA products are described by most users as accurate, valid, useful, comprehensive and readily available for their use. However, a small group of users who were less satisfied with the comprehensiveness of products indicated that the division could make more collective agreements (i.e., for small unions representing less than 100 employees) available and could conduct more analyses by region, occupation, industry, and unions to increase their usage. Users who were less satisfied with the timeliness indicated that sometimes answers to their urgent and complex requests were received too late, rendering the information no longer useful. </li>
<li>Impacts of changes made since 2010 were positive on WIRA operations: In 2011, WID and RDD merged into one single division, the Workplace Information and Research Division to manage WIRA operations. These changes were implemented in an effort to identify challenges and suggest ways to improve WIRA operations. This resulted in more WIRA products offered online increasing their accessibility. The changes also resulted in a reduction in the number of requests by e-mail, as well as in time and effort of staff involved in data collection and publication processes. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Recommendations</h3>
<p>To ensure that WIRA products and services continue to be meaningful for new, potential and regular users, it is recommended that:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Workplace Information and Research Division refines its engagement strategy to increase its client base and enhance awareness of WIRA products and services; </li>
<li>The Workplace Information and Research enhances the online user experience by improving the navigability and the search capabilities of online databases and the division’s website;</li>
<li>The Workplace Information and Research explores ways to improve the speed of processing users’ requests to ensure that information is available in time to be useful for its internal and external users; and</li>
<li>The Workplace Information and Research considers implementing its new Performance Measurement Strategy to collect appropriate data to better understand and serve the needs of users.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="h2.2">Management response</h2>
<h3>The Workplace Information and Research Division refines its engagement strategy to increase its client base and enhance awareness of WIRA products and services. </h3>
<p>The division agrees with this recommendation.</p>
<h4>Actions:</h4>
<p>A weekly survey of all individuals who have used WIRA products and services has been in place since January 2015 to collect information about users’ satisfaction with WIRA products and services, as well as suggestions for improvements. A monthly dashboard is produced for monitoring by the division’s management.</p>
<h4>Planned activities:</h4>
<ul>
<li>The division will ensure that contact information for users who make requests in-person or by email or phone is collected and entered correctly into the database. This will be an on-going practice.</li>
<li>The division will engage in consultations with ESDC partner branches (Innovation, Information and Technology Branch (IITB), Service Canada’s Citizen Service Branch (CSB), Privacy, and Legal Services) to explore the possibility of adding an online survey to the division’s website to collect contact information and gather users’ feedback on WIRA products and services online. The consultation will take place over the summer of 2015 with the objective of having the survey in place before the end of fiscal year 2015-2016.</li>
<li>The division will collaborate with the Public Affairs and Stakeholders Relation Branch (PASRB) to undertake communication initiatives to increase awareness, such as:</li>
</ul>
<h5>Twitter:</h5>
<ul>
<li>PASRB will send Tweets from the Labour Program Twitter account to improve the division’s visibility and highlight the availability of new products and services developed by the division with links to those products. This will be implemented on a case-by-case basis following final approval of the Management Response.</li>
<li>Similarly, Tweets containing quick facts and statistics extracted from the division’s publications will be used to promote the publications and may be used in cross‑promotion for Ministerial events or other Labour Program initiatives. This will be implemented following final approval of the Management Response.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Web feature:</h5>
<ul>
<li>A web feature will be developed for use on the Labour Program homepage to provide a link to new publications developed by the division to increase the visibility and accessibility of the division’s publications. This will be implemented following final approval of the Management Response. </li>
</ul>
<h5>Google Analytics:</h5>
<ul>
<li>Will be used to analyze visitor traffic and provide insight into how visitors use the division’s web pages.</li>
<li>Key words/common search terms, aligned with publication titles, will be used in future publications to ensure that the division’s publications are among the top search results lists. This will be completed by August 2015 and then done on an ongoing basis.</li>
<li>The “Common Questions” section of the Labour Program’s website will direct users looking for industrial relations information to the division’s Contact page. This will be implemented upon final approval of the Management Response.</li>
<li>The division will communicate with other organizations and professional associations who could potentially use its products and services, such as the Canadian Industrial Relations Association, Brock Labour Studies, and the Conseil du Patronat du Québec, to inform them about its products as well as to explore the possibility of having a direct link for the division’s online products on their respective websites. This will be an ongoing practice.</li>
<li>The division will implement an internal research newsletter to be sent out to Labour Program executives, policy analysts and others to be determined. The newsletter, to be launched by July 2015, will include a short summary of recently completed research reports, along with a division’s Share Point link to those documents. </li>
<li>The division will explore the possibility of having a link on the Labour Program intranet that will direct users to the division’s product page.</li>
<li>The division, in consultation with the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, will examine the feasibility of expanding the current thresholds for monitoring and analyzing collective agreements in both the federal and provincial jurisdictions and determine the need for this information and the resources required to expand the thresholds. This will be completed by December 2015.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Workplace Information and Research Division enhances the online user experience by improving the navigability and the search capabilities of online databases and the division’s website.</h3>
<p>The division agrees with this recommendation. It will need active support from IITB, CSB and PASRB to improve the navigability of the Labour Program (division) website.</p>
<h4>Planned activities:</h4>
<ul>
<li>The division will engage in consultations with the IITB, CSB and PASRB, over the summer of 2015, to explore possible improvements to the usability of the Labour Program website, keeping in mind the upcoming migration of Labour Program content to Canada.ca.</li>
<li>Subject to the availability of resources, the division will conduct a usability assessment of its online database Negotech to identify ways to enhance user experience. This will be completed by March 31, 2016.</li>
<li>As the division also releases its data through Statistics Canada, users access division’s product through the Canadian Socio-economic Information Management system (CANSIM) as well. The division will assess and redesign where necessary the format and content of work stoppages and wage data being sent to CANSIM. This will be completed by October 2015.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Workplace Information and Research Division explores ways to improve the speed of processing users’ requests to ensure that information is available in time to be useful for its internal and external users.</h3>
<p>The division agrees with this recommendation. Currently the majority of simple requests are responded to within the expected time frame of two business days. Timeliness refers to the elapsed time either to respond to user requests, or between expected and actual date for posting publications online. This timeliness is already being tracked and documented for each client request (ICAMS, since 2008) or for each publication (Divisional Application Toolbox (DAT) /Research, Analysis and Publication (RAP)) – Publication Status, since March 2015).</p>
<h4>Actions:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Users making complex requests are always consulted and advised on the expected timelines and kept apprised of any changes.</li>
<li>The division already has in place a number of measures to improve request processing time. Given current division’s capacity, further improvements in request processing time will require devoting more resources.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Planned activities:</h4>
<ul>
<li>The division will continue to monitor its ability to respond to requests in a timely manner based on the data captured by these applications (ICAMS and DAT) and the implementation of the Performance Management Strategy. This activity will be completed by March 2016.</li>
<li>The division will collect data on performance indicators to assess the quality, usefulness and timeliness of research reports using a short survey of internal requestors of complex research. Data collection and analysis will be completed by March 2016.</li>
<li>The division will begin tracking the time spent on the more complex research projects using a new Status Report to document the timelines of all projects undertaken by the division. The Status Report will be in place by May 2015.</li>
<li>The division will consult with PASRB to explore ways to further improve the timeliness of its online publications and also the possibility of establishing consistent publication schedules, as well as the identification of next steps. This consultation will take place during 2015-2016. </li>
</ul>
<h3>The Workplace Information and Research Division considers implementing its new Performance Measurement Strategy to collect appropriate data to better understand and serve the needs of users.</h3>
<p>The division agrees with this recommendation.</p>
<h4>Actions:</h4>
<ul>
<li>The division developed a Performance Measurement Strategy in April 2014. A number of performance indicators were identified to assess the performance of the division.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Planned activities:</h4>
<ul>
<li>The division will document and describe how the division’s activities effectively contribute to the division’s outputs and outcomes. This will be an on-going activity starting in September 2015.</li>
<li>The division will develop an appropriate performance data collection system by July 2015</li>
<li>On a continuous basis, data on performance indicators will be collected and analyzed to ensure they are accurate and relevant and will be used to improve the management of the division. The report on the first analysis will be completed by December 2015. </li>

<h2 id="h2.3">Introduction</h2>
<h3 id="h2.3-h3.1">1.1 Evaluation context</h3>
<p>This evaluation of the Workplace Information and Research Activities (WIRA) was undertaken as part of the ESDC Evaluation Plan 2013-2014 to 2017-2018 and with respect to the 2009 Treasury Board<em> Policy on Evaluation.</em> The program had not been previously evaluated in its 40 years of operation. </p>
<p>During the period from 2010-2011 to 2012-2013, the Workplace Information and Research Division made significant operational changes in its publication and data collection processes to increase efficiency as a result of the Business Process Redesign. The changes to WIRA operations prompted the necessity to conduct this current evaluation to understand if those changes were appropriate in helping to achieve expected results.</p>
<h3 id="h2.3-h3.2">1.2 Description of the Workplace Information and Research Division</h3>
<p>The Minister of Employment and Social Development Canada is mandated to collect, analyze, interpret, publish and disseminate information relating to human resources and skills development or to social development, as stipulated by the article 6(a) of the <em>Employment and Social Development Act</em>. This includes data and information on labour relations in Canada.</p>
<p>ESDC’s Labour Program is responsible for the collection, analysis and dissemination of data and information on labour matters in both federal and provincial labour jurisdictions. These activities were performed by the Workplace Information Division (WID) which existed within Labour Program for more than 40 years until 2010. In 2007, the Research and Data Development unit (RDD) started conducting research activities including analysis and research on emerging issues, programs and policies to support the Labour Program mandate. In 2010-2011, WID and RDD merged into one single division, the Workplace Information and Research Division (the division), currently responsible for the Workplace Information and Research Activities (WIRA) in the Labour Program. </p>
<p>The division collects, analyzes and disseminates information on collective bargaining in both federal and provincial jurisdictions. The division collects information on collective bargaining processes and agreements, work stoppages, as well as on Canadian labour organizations’ membership and affiliations. The division has both internal and external users of its WIRA products and services. Internal users include Labour Program groups, senior management and Ministers. External clients include TBS, Statistics Canada, the Bank of Canada, unions, employers, researchers, lawyers, consultants, media and the general public, as well as the International Labour Organization. WIRA products and services are used by negotiating parties to facilitate collective bargaining processes, by government officials for policy development and decision making, and by researchers for their work in the area of labour relations. The division also helps to meet the government’s international obligations by providing reports on work stoppages to the International Labour Organization on an annual basis. In addition, information on wage adjustments, work stoppages and wage projections is shared with TBS, Statistics Canada and the Bank of Canada. </p>
<p>The division conducts research and econometric/statistical analyses related to collective bargaining and all other areas of the Labour Program mandate, such as labour standards, occupational health and safety, employment and pay. The research and analyses produced by the division are used by the Labour Program for policy development, by the Department of Finance and the Bank of Canada to monitor macroeconomic conditions, and by TBS to monitor collective bargaining and negotiations. In addition, the division supports TBS and ESDC in the analysis of the economic impact of various labour issues. </p>
<p>The budget (operations and salaries) for WIRA has been declining from $3.3 million in fiscal year 2009-2010 to $ 2.4 million in 2012-2013. </p>
<h2 id="h2.4">2. Evaluation scope, questions and methodology </h2>
<p>The evaluation assessed the relevance and continued need as well as the effectiveness and efficiency of WIRA. The evaluation focused on identifying WIRA products and services and determining who the various users of WIRA products and services are. The evaluation also examined the quality and the accessibility of WIRA products and services, as well as their impacts on collective bargaining and labour policy development processes. </p>
<p>The six evaluation questions examined as part of this evaluation are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>To what extent are WIRA products (information, analyses and research reports) accurate, reliable and relevant to types of users (Unions, employers, researchers, Labour Program managers, etc.)? </li>
<li>To what extent are WIRA aligned with ESDC and the government-wide priorities and jurisdiction? </li>
<li>To what extent are the WIRA duplicating or complementing or enabling other ESDC programs, initiatives or functions? </li>
<li>To what extent are WIRA products accessible to different types of users (unions, employers, researchers, labour program managers, etc.) in a timely manner? </li>
<li>What are the impacts of WIRA products (information, analyses and research reports) on the dialogue and negotiations related to collective bargaining and on policy development in the Labour Program? </li>
<li>To what extent has the business process redesign improved the efficiency of the core operational processes, enhanced services to users, and prepared WIRA for open data? </li>
</ul>
<p>The evaluation covered the division’s research activities and operations during the fiscal years, 2008-2009 to 2012-2013. </p>
<p>The methodology used five lines of evidence:</p>
<ul>
<li>Document review;</li>
<li>Administrative data analysis; </li>
<li>Key informant interviews with Labour Program representatives;</li>
<li>Survey of users of WIRA products and services; and </li>
<li>Surveys of potential users of WIRA products and services.</li>
</ul>
<p>Detailed information on the evaluation methodologies and their strengths and limitations are found in Appendix B. </p>

<a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn26">
<span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>26</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Most Labour Program representatives who are frequent users of WIRA products and services (including research reports) indicated that their future needs of WIRA products will increase. The capability of the division’s research group to produce high quality products is acknowledged within the department, and the division has started to solicit research ideas from other groups in the Labour Program. As a result, the number of requests for research products has increased from a wide variety of internal federal government users, including those in the Labour policy group, Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, Federal Compensation, Employment Equity, Occupational Health and Safety, and Labour Standards.<sup id="fn27-rf">
<a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn27">
<span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>27</a>
</sup>
</p>
<p>TBS and the Bank of Canada request information on collective agreements, including the information on wage adjustments on a monthly basis and wage projections on a yearly basis. The division also shares data on work stoppages with Statistics Canada on a quarterly basis.<sup id="fn28-rf">
<a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn28">
<span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>28</a>
</sup> These requests are ongoing and there is no indication that the demand for WIRA products by these organizations will change in the near future.</p>
<h4>WIRA products and services support the ESDC mandate and Strategic Outcome 2: “Safe, fair and productive workplace and cooperative workplace relations.”</h4>
<p>WIRA align with the ESDC Strategic Outcome 2: “<em>Safe, fair and productive workplaces and cooperative workplace relations</em>” as reflected in the ESDC Program Alignment Architectures for 2012-2013 and 2013-2014.<sup id="fn29-rf">
<a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn29">
<span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>29</a>
</sup> WIRA products on collective agreement processes also contribute to the promotion and sustainability of cooperative workplace relations within the federal jurisdiction and beyond (Departmental Performance Reports 2012-2013). As per the <em>Canada Labour Code</em>, Section 115, the division helps to fulfill ESDC’s regulatory mandate to collect and disseminate information on collective agreements. </p>
<h4>WIRA products and services are aligned with the Federal Government’s interest/priorities </h4>
<p>Key informant interviewees were unanimous that WIRA products and services are well aligned with ESDC and government-wide priorities. Users indicated that WIRA products are used for planning, negotiating and settling collective agreements.<sup id="fn30-rf">
<a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn30">
<span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>30</a>
</sup> The document review revealed that economic impact studies are the most common research reports prepared by the division. These studies are conducted to assess the impact that workers’ actions, employers’ decisions and government legislation may have on the productivity and economic interests of businesses, industry and Canada as a whole. WIRA research products are prepared primarily to support Labour Program and Government of Canada decision makers in the domain of labour relations and all related issues to the <em>Canada Labour Code</em> to ensure good working relations and prevent loss of productivity. Supporting this, key informants indicated that WIRA products are used to prepare presentations and briefing notes for senior managers, including ministers, on different labour files. WIRA research and other products also assist TBS in implementing the government's priority of preventing loss of productivity.<sup id="fn31-rf">

</p>
<h4>WIRA support the Government of Canada to fulfill its international reporting commitments. </h4>
<p>The division helps ESDC to meet the government’s international reporting obligations and respond to requests on labour matters from the International Labour Organization, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development and other countries. The document review indicated that, on an annual basis, the division reports Canadian nation-wide work stoppages information to the International Labour Organization. The work stoppages information that Statistics Canada publishes comes from the division, which is the unique source of information on work stoppages at the national level in Canada. At the provincial/territorial level, only three provinces −British Columbia, Alberta and Ontario− offer information on work stoppages similar to WIRA products. However, their information focuses on activities within their respective jurisdictions, and therefore lacks the national perspective required to fulfill Canadian international obligations.<sup id="fn32-rf">
<a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn32">
<span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>32</a>
</sup> In addition, the division has no current working arrangements with Provinces and Territories to share information. The division may consider collaborating with at least the above three provinces and other major labour organizations, to share information and analysis of mutual interest. </p>
<h4>WIRA products and services play an enabling function for other Labour Program groups </h4>
<p>The value of WIRA products and services is rooted not just in its federal focus, but also in its focus on the Labour Program. The word “enabling” was repeatedly used by key informants to describe the impact WIRA have on other Labour Program groups. Many frequent internal users felt that their work was dependent upon WIRA information and products. </p>
<p>Users of research products from other Labour Program groups consider that their jobs would be difficult without the help from the WIRA research group. For those users, no other research groups in ESDC offer the same type and quality of research and data pertaining to the Labour Program mandate.<sup id="fn33-rf">
<a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn33">

<h4>The division acts as a single repository of collective agreements and related information in Canada. This does not duplicate the activities of other federal departments or provinces and territories in this regard. </h4>
<p>Findings from the document review indicated that the online database, Negotech, maintained by the division, contained 44,094 collective agreements collected from both public and private sectors in Canada.<sup id="fn36-rf">

</sup> Although copies of some collective agreements are available from a variety of other sources, the division is identified as the single repository of the majority of collective agreements in Canada. It is important to mention that provinces and territories, large public sector employers such as universities or hospitals, provide information on their collective agreements and cite Negotech and ESDC among their sources of information. The province of Manitoba provides a direct link to WIRA products as a source of national and provincial information. Other online sources include: large public sector employers such as universities or hospitals; major unions and labour organizations.<sup id="fn38-rf">

<p>Information on collective agreements available on provincial websites varies by province, and rarely dates back prior to 2002. Three provinces −British Columbia, Alberta and Ontario− provide some basic data and analyses such as quarterly wage settlements, wage settlement summaries, status of major negotiations and work stoppages, similar to WIRA products, but only since 2012. Both the Conference Board of Canada and Statistics Canada were mentioned as alternative sources of information but their focus is limited to topics of specific nature.<sup id="fn39-rf">

Provinces and territories and other labour organizations maintain information on collective agreements for unions similar to those covered by the division, and also for smaller unions in their jurisdictions. In addition to the issue of coverage, some organizations want to conduct different types of analyses than what the division is currently providing. This is consistent with responses of some users. For example, 44 respondents to the User Survey noted why they were unlikely to use WIRA products and services in the future: less than 66% indicated the need for new products or broadened information (i.e., on small unions) and 9% wanted more detailed information on existing products.<sup id="fn41-rf">

<p>The division produces accurate, valid, useful, comprehensive and timely information that has an impact on collective bargaining and labour related policy development and decision-making processes.

<h4>The majority of users assessed the WIRA products and services as accurate, valid, and useful. However, the levels of satisfaction with timeliness and comprehensiveness were lower. </h4>
<p>Key informant interviewees reported that the process by which information on collective agreements is collected and prepared ensures its accuracy. To achieve this, the division maintains an up-to-date calendar of collective agreements to determine when new data will be available. Information is collected directly from unions, ensuring its accuracy and completeness and it is verified before being released to the public.<sup id="fn42-rf">

<p>The division’s research capabilities are regarded as very valuable by Labour Program groups as well as other federal departments, agencies and crown corporations. These organizations need the division’s expertise to help in the preparation of policy papers and ministerial briefing notes. The division also receives requests to prepare costing for policy options and impacts related to Labour relations issues. </p>
<p>To ensure that research planning takes policy needs into consideration, a Director-General level consultation process with other Labour Program groups has been established. Several Labour Program users commented positively on the initiative. It is seen as an important and positive tool to help the division tailor its research (and products) to its users’ needs. The key informant interviewees suggested that information shared at the Director-General level also needs to be shared between Directors and filtered down.<sup id="fn45-rf">
<a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn45">

<p>The users of WIRA products and services expressed a high level of satisfaction regarding quality in general, but their satisfaction was lower in terms of product comprehensiveness and timeliness. The majority of respondents to the User Survey noted that WIRA products are accurate (86%), valid (88%), and useful (86%), but satisfaction was lower for comprehensiveness (78%) and timeliness (69%).

</p>
<p><strong>Comprehensiveness</strong>
</p>
<p>The low level of user satisfaction related to the comprehensiveness of WIRA products and services is possibly explained by the current division’s union size coverage. This is consistent with what current users would like to see as new division’s products. Their suggestions indicated the need for new products or a broadened scope of current products to include smaller unions and detailed analyses.<sup id="fn47-rf">

</sup> This suggests that information on small unions would meet a certain number of users’ needs. </p>
<p><strong>Timeliness</strong>
</p>
<p>The low satisfaction level among users surveyed about the timeliness may be explained by the following: </p>
<ul>
<li>the user’s waiting time for information requested; </li>
<li>the time elapsed between the expected date of publication and when the information was finally published; and </li>
<li>the time it took to find information when the user was searching on the division’s website or database. </li>
</ul>
<p>Thirty-one per cent of respondents to the User Survey required assistance in accessing the information they requested. The majority of these respondents (80%) found it easy to obtain the necessary help from the division. Satisfaction with the timeliness of the help received among its users is very high (88%). Dissatisfaction rises sharply when respondents have to wait more than seven days for assistance.<sup id="fn50-rf">

<p>Most key informants reported that when they needed information from the division, they generally received it within their specified timeframe. However, some key informants reported that for certain requests, the information was provided too late and was therefore no longer useful. The division’s managers also indicated that this happens for special requests that require more research and more time to produce the requested information. </p>

<p>The division conducts various types of activities to produce research reports. These reports differ in scope, depth and levels of analysis, and can range from a briefing note of a few pages to a major research paper of 20 or more pages. The division also conducts literature reviews, prepares descriptive statistics and generates statistical models as required by a project. These reports/papers address topics related to the Labour Program’s mandate such as occupational health and safety (i.e., rates of workplace injury, rates of industry compliance with occupational health and safety standards), unionization (i.e., union coverage rates, effectiveness of unions), worker rights and wage issues, and other outstanding issues such as the impacts of new developments (i.e., back-to-work legislation). As well, they inform policy development in the above mentioned areas.</p>
<p>Economic impact analyses are the most common research reports prepared by the division. These analyses assess the impact that actions of workers, the decisions of employers and government legislation may have on the productivity and economic interests of businesses, industry and Canada as a whole.

<h4>The decision to place more products online resulted in increased access to WIRA products and services through the Internet and a decreased number of requests by e-mail. </h4>
<p>The administrative data analysis indicated that the use of the Internet to make requests for WIRA products and services has increased since 2010. The increase in Internet-based requests corresponds with more WIRA products being published and made accessible online since 2010 and a corresponding decline of requests by e-mail and by telephone (Figure 2).

<p>The users of WIRA products and services have increasingly moved to online access but some are still contacting the division by phone or email. Certain users emphasized that this is necessary to provide and seek clarity on ad-hoc and complex requests. It may be worthwhile to anticipate a need for additional staff to respond to possible increased numbers of ad-hoc and more complex requests.</p>
<h4>Changes made since 2010 to WIRA operations have positively impacted the quality and accessibility of WIRA products, as well as on WIRA operations.</h4>
<p>The division is contributing to the Government of Canada’s “Blueprint 2020” and “High Performing Organization” agenda by finding ways to process products and requests more efficiently. For example, a backlog in the preparation of the summaries of collective agreements was outstanding for three years. By making changes to streamline its business operations, the division was able to clear this backlog in three months without increasing its level of resources.<sup id="fn64-rf">

<h4>Development of the Performance Measurement Strategy (PM Strategy)</h4>
<p>The document review indicated that the 2014 PM Strategy requires the monitoring of publication timelines to ensure that reports, data tables, and other products are completed and published on time. The PM Strategy recommends the inclusion of a client feedback tool to continuously assess regular user satisfaction.<sup id="fn73-rf">
<a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn73">

<a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn74">
<span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>74</a>
</sup> This suggests that it is important to implement the PM Strategy and to refine the theory of change underlying WIRA to help in targeting and optimizing changes to better meet the needs of users. To do so, the division needs to improve its logic model by clearly outlining and documenting the causal relationships between inputs, activities, outputs and outcomes. These causal relationships would articulate the needs of different clients, their points of contact with WIRA, the products they access, and how they utilize the products. This information would result in the improvement of data currently being collected and could enable the division to more efficiently and effectively target its products to users and realize its optimal capacity.</p>
<h4>Some WIRA products are ready for Open Data<sup id="fn75-rf">

<h4>There is a need for greater awareness and promotion of WIRA products and services.</h4>
<p>Overall, awareness of both WIRA products and research services appears to be lacking among infrequent users. Key informants reported that the division is not actively trying to increase awareness of its products. Infrequent users indicated that they would not know about new WIRA products if they did not actively search for them. It was noted that efforts were made in the past to inform users on updates to WIRA products, but these efforts were discontinued due to budgetary and time constraints. Currently, the division has no activities devoted to informing new users of its products.<sup id="fn81-rf">
<a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn81">
<span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>81</a>
</sup> Some key informants suggested the use of a newsletter or e-letter to inform users about new products, while surveyed users suggested using the current Workplace Bulletin to communicate the information about WIRA products. These suggestions could help to inform regular users but not new ones. In fact, the User Survey revealed that one-third (34%) of users became aware by conducting self-directed research or web searches that led them to the division’s website. Others became aware because of their job function or they were directly informed by their employer or co-worker.<sup id="fn82-rf">

A strategy that relies on the division’s website alone or only a newsletter or a bulletin could leave a large number of potential users unaware of WIRAproducts.</p>
<p>For research products, several key informants noted that the new the division’s research plan consultation process and the use of SharePoint as a platform for making users aware of the available reports and analyses are both positive steps forward. These initiatives have increased the awareness of the division’s research capabilities. The consultation process has also allowed the division’s researchers and analysts to get a better understanding of the research needs of the end users of their reports.<sup id="fn83-rf">

<h2 id="h2.6">4. Conclusion</h2>
<p>Evaluation findings show that there is an ongoing need and demand for information on collective agreements and WIRA products and services to support collective bargaining, policy development and decision-making processes in the area of labour relations. </p>
<p>WIRA products are predominantly viewed as enabling other branches of the Labour Program, as well as other federal departments, agencies and Crown corporations in their reporting responsibilities. In addition, WIRA support Canada in fulfilling its international reporting responsibilities by providing reports to the International Labour Organization on an annual basis. Given their national focus, WIRA products and services are unique and do not duplicate the activities of any other organizations in Canada. </p>
<p>WIRA products and services are reported by a majority of users and particularly by frequent users as reliable, accurate, valid, comprehensive, timely and useful in supporting collective agreement negotiations and settling labour disputes. However, the comprehensiveness of WIRA products can be further enhanced by increasing the scope of collection of information on small unions (representing under 100 employees) which is not the current focus of WIRA and conducting customized analyses by regions, occupations, industry and unions.</p>
<p>Changes undertaken to WIRA’s operations since 2010, including offering more WIRA products online and on Open Data have made their products available to a larger audience. The implementation of the recently developed PM Strategy is expected to collect performance information, which will contribute to further enhancements and improvements to WIRA operations and to matching WIRA products and services with their users’ needs. Having more WIRA products on Open Data will increase the usage of those products and reduce requests for some specific analyses by a variety of former and new users. Overall, the division is providing a unique service to selected Canadian and international organizations in the area of labour relations.</p>
<h2 id="h2.7">5. Recommendations</h2>
<p>For WIRA to meet the needs of new, potential and regular users, it is recommended that: </p>
<h3>1. The Workplace Information and Research Division refines its engagement strategy to increase its client base and enhance awareness of WIRA products and services. </h3>
<p>Regular communication with users to maintain a good client base and seeking their feedback is essential to increasing uptake, usage and quality of WIRA products and services, and facilitates matching of WIRA products with users’ needs. Communication in the form of newsletters or e-letters can be considered as important media to keep most users informed about new and existing products and ways to access those products. However, multiple communication strategies would be more effective. For research planning, the division may consider building on the consultation process undertaken in spring 2014 to ensure that all users of research products, including internal analysts, are properly consulted and engaged in the research planning process. Making other labour organizations aware of WIRA products and services and exploring the possibility for expanding the current analysis threshold would help to increase the division client base.</p>
<h3>2. The Workplace Information and Research Division enhances the online user experience by improving the navigability and the search capabilities of online databases and the division’s website.</h3>
<p>The division should consider conducting a usability assessment of the division’s website and particularly Negotech. The issues around the navigation of the division’s website, how to use the website and where to find the needed information, are some areas for improvement. The division could coordinate with ESDC’s Innovation, Information and Technology Branch to discover appropriate ways to improve accessibility and usage of WIRA products. </p>
<h3>3. The Workplace Information and Research Division explores ways to improve the speed of processing users’ requests to ensure that information is available in time to be useful for its internal and external users.</h3>
<p>Timeliness is important for any information to be useful. The process and time to respond to requests for WIRA products and services need to be monitored to ensure timeliness is respected and adhered to. Efforts are needed to improve how quickly the division responds to users’ requests. It is also important that people who make special requests for WIRA products and services are informed of the turnaround times to process their requests. </p>
<h3>4. The Workplace Information and Research Division considers implementing its new Performance Measurement Strategy to collect appropriate data to better understand and serve the needs of users.</h3>
<p>Clearly outlining and documenting the causal relationships between inputs, activities, outputs and outcomes could offer insight into how and why users access WIRA products and services. This information could enable WIRA to more efficiently and effectively target its products and services to users and continue to effect changes that are appropriate. The PM Strategy and the division’s Theory of Change should be validated on a regular basis to ensure they continue to reflect the actual context of the division.</p>

<h2 id="h2.11">Appendix B: Methodologies, strengths and limitations</h2>
<h3>Methodologies</h3>
<p>The evaluation of the Workplace Information and Research Activities (WIRA) used five different data collection methods (lines of evidence) to answer the evaluation questions. The data collection methods included: </p>
<ul>
<li>a document review; </li>
<li>administrative data analysis; </li>
<li>key informant interviews with Labour Program representatives; </li>
<li>a survey of users of products/ services from WIRA; and </li>
<li>a survey of potential users.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Administrative data analysis</h3>
<p>The division administrative data analysis was conducted in an effort to determine what and how products and services are delivered, their distribution, the characteristics of the client population and the division’s performance. The administrative data included ICAMS, which is the Internal Client Access Management System. It records information on clients who are making direct contact with WIRA, either by e-mail or the 1-800 line. It contains client contact information, their organization, the nature of their request, the time to fulfill the request. Reports can be generated by a variety of criteria, e.g. client type, nature of product requested. It should be noted that ICAMS does not capture those internal users who make specific requests through methods other than e-mails and telephone calls for research and analyses. </p>
<h3>Document review</h3>
<p>The document review involved an examination of internal (division) and external documents. The division documents were reviewed for detailed information on division activities, costs, and performance. External documents were reviewed to provide an understanding of the context of collective agreement negotiations and industrial relations in Canadian workplaces within the federal and provincial/territorial jurisdictions. The document review also served to collect information on alternative products and services available to federal and private sector labour-management parties to help them with their collective agreement negotiations.</p>
<h4>Strength and limitations of administrative data analysis and document review</h4>
<p><strong>Strengths:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>A large number of detailed documents were available for the evaluation.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Limitations:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>The administrative data is difficult to compare with the survey data because it is based on information from users who made requests for information to the division by e-mail, telephone or in-person. One person may have made multiple requests leading to duplicate records. </li>
<li>The administrative data collection process does not ask participants for their affiliation, while the Known User Survey did. Caution should be exercised when making comparisons between numbers from both sources in terms of user categories, product ratings or popularity.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Key informant interviews</h3>
<p>Fourteen key informant interviews with program officials from ESDC’s Labour Program Branch were conducted to gather their opinions on the context and relevance of WIRA products and services and the extent to which WIRA products are used internally to support policy development as well as program and policy reviews. Among the 14 key informants, 5 were from the division, with the remaining participants from other Labour Program groups.</p>
<h4>Strength and limitations of key informant interviews </h4>
<p><strong>Strengths:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>The 14 key informants who participated in the evaluation were senior level management from within the division and other relevant areas within the Labour Program. Their experience, length of service and different perspectives allowed for a rich understanding of WIRA.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Limitations:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>An important caveat to note is that those who participated in the evaluation as key informants may have a vested interest in the WIRA or partial knowledge of the division’s process and products. </li>
<li>It should be noted that for infrequent users, the reasons for not using WIRA products vary depending on the persons interviewed. Reasons such the lack of awareness, the low frequency of the need for WIRA products or the products not meeting the need of the user are all possible. It is then, not easy to separate their views about WIRA products from their respective circumstances. </li>
<li>While the report makes the distinction between WIRA products and its research services, it was not clear from the key informant interviews that users make that distinction. The division is analogous to a grocery store that has pre-packaged products, but also has a deli that provides product to their customers’ specifications. Customers come for one product and seamlessly purchase the other – both are food. The division offers information, some pre-packaged and some made to meet client-specific needs. During the interviews, respondents were asked about the accuracy of WIRA products and services. In this report the products and services have been separated out, with a focus on products, but it is likely that users’ experience with one would have a profound impact on their assessment of the other. Caution should be exercised in overly compartmentalizing the respondents’ viewpoints.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Survey of users </h3>
<p>The survey of users of WIRA products and services was conducted to determine the extent to which each product or service is being used to inform collective bargaining and negotiation processes, for what other purposes they are used, how they meet the users’ needs and to what extent these products and services help the collective negotiation process. Surveyed users included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Users of WIRA who requested information from the division by e-mail or telephone during the last five years (2008-2013); </li>
<li>Federal government users namely TBS and the Bank of Canada who receive monthly wage settlement statistics and wage projections;</li>
<li>Representatives of labour organizations holding collective agreements or in bargaining processes;</li>
<li>Others who were identified by the previous three categories of survey respondents to be users of WIRA but for whom the division does not have contact information. Unfortunately, this process did not produce enough new contacts to be helpful. </li>
</ul>
<h4>Strength and limitations of the Users Surveys</h4>
<p><strong>Strengths:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>The participation rate of the Known User Survey was 22% from a total sample of 992. This provided a sufficiently large enough response base to allow for meaningful analysis.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Limitations:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>The key limitation was the lack of information on the number and the characteristics of users who access WIRA products through the Internet only. </li>
<li>There is also a potential selection bias, as the public servants who seem to access WIRA products more frequently than others, may not have responded to the survey with the same motivation as external users. </li>
<li>The User Report included both Known and Unknown Users. Obtaining the participation of Unknown Users was a challenge; only 12 participated. These users were amalgamated with the Known Users but, as previously mentioned, were drawn from a population of unions and labour organizations.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Survey of potential users</h3>
<p>The survey of potential users was conducted to assess awareness of WIRA products and services among individuals and organizations that are viewed as potential targets of WIRA products and services, but do not use them. In addition, the survey of potential users was also intended to examine why WIRA products and services were not being used and to explore the existence of other alternative sources of information that may be available to inform collective negotiation processes for those users. </p>
<h4>Strength and Limitations of the survey of potential users</h4>
<p><strong>Strengths:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>The participation rate of the Potential User Survey was 21% from a total sample of 513. This provided a sufficiently large enough response base to allow for meaningful analysis.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Limitations:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Respondents to this survey included those who were certain they had never used WIRA products or services, and those who were unsure. The dataset likely included respondents who were previous users, who stopped using WIRA products and services. The concept of a Potential User should not be limited to those who have never used the products or services before. Lapsed users may be converted to active users given the right circumstances, such as communication initiatives that correct mistaken impressions of the division’s capabilities.</li>
</ul>
