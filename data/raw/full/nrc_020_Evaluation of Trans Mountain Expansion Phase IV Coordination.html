<h2>Indigenous Land Acknowledgement</h2>
<p>The Audit and Evaluation Branch (AEB) of Natural Resources Canada acknowledges that our offices, located in Ottawa, are on the traditional and unceded Territory of the Algonquin Anishinaabe People. We recognize that those reading this report may live and work in a different traditional Indigenous territory. Though our offices are in one place, we are committed to drawing on a range of knowledges and experiences to support evidence-informed decision-making that has broad potential benefits and can hopefully contribute to collective action to build a stronger society. </p>
<p>Within the province of British Columbia, the Trans Mountain pipeline crosses numerous traditional territories and 15 First Nation Reserves. Within the province of Alberta, the Trans Mountain pipeline route spans across multiple First Nations Traditional Territories of Treaty 6, Treaty 7, Treaty 8, and the Métis Nation of Alberta.  </p>
<p>We recognize that the Indigenous Nations within the colonial borders of Canada have lived on this land, Turtle Island, and their respective territories for time immemorial. We recognize that their languages, cultures, vibrant histories, and continuous stewardship over the land enriches our communities and generations past, present, and future.  </p>

<h2 id="2">Executive Summary </h2>
<h3><strong>About the  Evaluation</strong><strong> </strong></h3>
<p>This report presents  the findings, conclusions, and recommendations from the evaluation of the  coordination structures supporting the Government of Canada’s post-decision implementation  (Phase IV) of the Trans Mountain Expansion (TMX) project. NRCan's AEB undertook  the evaluation between June 2021 and March 2022, with participation from  partner departments and agencies engaged in the coordination of TMX Phase IV  implementation (i.e., Canadian Coast Guard, Environment and Climate Change  Canada, Fisheries and Oceans Canada, and Transport Canada). </p>
<p>The evaluation  examined the design and effectiveness of these coordination structures from  June 2019 to December 2021, including the activities of partner departments in  facilitating the intended results. The objectives of this evaluation are:</p>
<ul>
<li>To assess the extent to which TMX Phase IV  coordination structures have been implemented as planned and can demonstrate  progress towards intended results.</li>
<li>Given results achieved to date and status of  implementation, to assess the ongoing relevance of NRCan’s TMX Phase IV coordination.</li>
<li>To identify and document lessons learned from  early implementation that can be used to improve the performance of these  functions and/or be applied to future interventions.</li>
</ul>
<p>The evaluation  responds to a Treasury Board (TB) commitment to complete an evaluation by March  2022 and aligns with the broader approach  to evaluation of TMX Phase IV coordination approved by the Heads of  Evaluation of both NRCan and partner departments in 2019.</p>
<h3><strong>What the  Evaluation Found</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>Planned vs  Actual Delivery</strong></h4>
<p>The evaluation  found that the Government of Canada has established suitable governance  mechanisms to coordinate the Crown’s implementation and delivery of the  TMX-Phase IV activities and that these governance structures were operational  in 2019. NRCan’s TMX coordination structures - i.e., the Strategic and Policy  Coordination team (NRCan-SPC) and Phase IV Partnership Office (NRCan-P4PO) were  also both fully operational in 2019. Overall, while the roles fulfilled by  NRCan have been relatively well defined and consistent, the organizational  structure and titles associated with NRCan’s TMX coordination structures have  changed frequently over time to account for evolving roles. </p>
<p>These TMX  coordination structures were structured and operating as planned, with one key  exception – NRCan-P4PO has not fully fulfilled its intended role as a “single  window” for Indigenous engagement. For various reasons, partner departments  have developed or maintained their own relationships and are interacting  directly with Indigenous groups. Notwithstanding this approach, NRCan-P4PO is  still perceived by most respondents to play an important role in management of  unique issues that are more sensitive or complex and in cross-departmental coordination.</p>
<p>Each department is  accountable for the TMX Phase IV initiative(s) it leads, and reports on this  through their own governance structures as well as interdepartmentally. The workload related to TMX coordination  is not perceived as sustainable by partner departments, which report having  underestimated the level of effort that would be required for coordination and  reporting. </p>
<h4><strong>Effectiveness of  the Strategic Policy and Coordination Team</strong></h4>
<p>Overall, we found that NRCan-SPC has created effective tools  and processes to support federal coordination. While NRCan-SPC coordination has  enabled efficiencies in some areas, improvements are still required for  existing mechanisms to ease the flow of information. Our observations relating  to NRCan-SPC’s specific activities are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Progress Reporting to Governance Bodies. </strong>Overall,<strong> </strong>progress reporting to governance bodies is effective and key governance  bodies are well supported. However, the Director General-level committee could  be more effective.</li>
<li><strong>Strategic  Oversight and Direction. </strong>Strategic  direction and oversight provided were perceived to be effective by  senior federal respondents but ineffective by those at the working level. The  efficiency of tools and supporting processes could be improved. Nevertheless, while consensus on decisions was not  always possible, NRCan-SPC is perceived to be open and transparent in working  to resolve cross-cutting issues in the face of divergent views.</li>
<li><strong>Consistent Messaging.</strong> NRCan-SPC was  perceived to be effective in influencing consistent messaging for the public,  Indigenous peoples, and partner departments, although some key information  products (e.g., updates to TMX website) were significantly delayed. There is  also a perceived lack of clear delineation between the activities and  responsibilities related to “communication” versus “engagement”.</li>
<li><strong>Regulatory Coordination.</strong> NRCan-SPC was  generally perceived as being effective in fulfilling its intended role for  regulatory coordination. Respondents from TMC noted that they were not entirely  satisfied with the speed of regulatory approvals but acknowledged that NRCan  helped facilitate and expedite this process (along with key decision makers in  DFO and ECCC).</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Effectiveness of  the Phase IV Partnership Office</strong></h4>
<p>Federal key  informants generally perceived NRCan-P4PO to be an innovative approach to  engagement on major projects. However, there may be a gap between Ministerial  expectations on this point, i.e., need to move quickly and work differently,  and actual practice at the working level. Regardless,  federal respondents largely agreed that NRCan-P4PO has been effective in its  coordination role, helping partner departments navigate complexity, addressing  more sensitive issues impacting a small number of Indigenous groups, and  providing a coordinated voice on whole-of-government issues.  </p>
<p>NRCan-P4PO has put  in place various trackers and tools as required to support coordination of the  whole-of-government engagement process. While these tools are effective, the  evaluation found limitations in some tracking systems to support effective  performance measurement. These systems were not robust enough to provide  accurate assessment of the depth of NRCan’s engagement.</p>
<p>The engagement  strategy developed by NRCan-P4PO was finalized relatively late in Phase IV  implementation. While this did not delay initial outreach to Indigenous groups,  key communications products (e.g., P4PO newsletter and TMX Indigenous Portal)  were either delayed or underused.</p>
<p>Evidence suggests  that NRCan-P4PO regularly engages with a large number of Indigenous groups and  has met its performance targets for initial outreach and engagement. However, NRCan-P4PO  metrics do not provide information on the meaningfulness of engagement. While  they represent a limited sample of Indigenous groups, the evaluation’s Indigenous  respondents generally rated the effectiveness of P4PO’s engagement as “poor” to  “fair” and provided diverse perspectives on the meaningfulness of its  engagement. The evaluation found evidence of a few successful attempts to  triage, streamline and tailor the Crown’s engagement to reflect Indigenous groups’  concerns, interests, and project-related impacts. However, the federal approach  to engagement on TMX has not been effective in reducing engagement fatigue.  When compared to other GOC initiatives, NRCan-P4PO did not stand out as a model  of coordination on engagement.</p>
<p>It is not clear  whether required improvements would be the responsibility of NRCan-P4PO or  partner departments. Even if successfully implemented for TMX, there would  still be a limitation in this project-specific single window approach in that  it would not coordinate across other (non-TMX) federal initiatives. </p>
<h4><strong>Facilitating and  Impeding Factors</strong></h4>
<p>We found several external and internal factors that have or  could influence the effective and efficient delivery of federal coordination  related to TMX Phase IV implementation. Impeding factors with the greatest  impact on the effectiveness of NRCan-SPC were perceived to be GOC capacity and  the federal decision-making and accountability regime for TMX (i.e., that NRCan  was given the mandate and accountability for coordination but does not have the  authority to direct the actions of partner departments). By contrast, key  factors impeding the effectiveness of NRCan-P4PO relate more so to the federal  government’s and Indigenous groups’ capacity for (coordinated) engagement. </p>
<p>The quality of support from NRCan-TMX teams and ongoing  support from senior management have facilitated effectiveness of TMX  coordination. While there are some factors over which the NRCan-TMX  coordination structures have little to no influence (e.g., unforeseen natural  disasters), the evaluation found several instances where NRCan has identified  and addressed impediments to effective coordination.  For example, NRCan-P4PO has recognized and  made attempts to respond to a need for additional capacity for Indigenous groups.  Regardless, Indigenous respondents to the evaluation perceived room to improve  skillsets for engagement (e.g., tailored communications) and reported  challenges with building and maintaining relationships, particularly given high  levels of turnover in federal staff.</p>
<h4><strong>Ongoing Need for  TMX Phase IV Coordination</strong></h4>
<p>NRCan and partner departments  generally agree on the continued need for TMX Phase IV coordination and  advocated a need to preserve the corporate knowledge built during the  implementation of TMX Phase IV. This need will endure at least as long as the  accommodation measures are still being implemented and/or construction is  ongoing. While NRCan may currently be best placed to lead on coordination  across departments, where the coordination function is located is not perceived  to be important provided it continues to ensure that the Crown’s commitments  made during Phase III consultations and Phase IV are being met. </p>
<p>There is stronger  support expressed towards maintaining NRCan-SPC than NRCan-P4PO. For senior  managers, the key question relates not to continued need for NRCan-SPC but  rather the resource levels required to sustain oversight and coordination. By  contrast, many respondents indicated that the role of NRCan-P4PO could be  reduced now that accommodations are in progress and partner departments have  built their own direct relationships with Indigenous groups.</p>
<h4><strong>Lessons Learned</strong></h4>
<p>As highlighted  above, the evaluation identified the areas for improvement that could support  ongoing delivery of TMX Phase IV. It also identified lessons related to  engagement post-decision on major projects, as well as a need to manage the  precedent set by TMX and further advance reconciliation with Indigenous  peoples. These lessons learned do not lead to easy solutions but are also not  unique to TMX. Related lessons learned from current and past program reviews  should be reviewed collectively and shared across the federal government to  inform future initiatives.</p>

<thead>
<tr>
<th class="active">Recommendation</th>
<th class="active">Management Response and Action Plan</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><p><strong>Recommendation 1.</strong> NRCan’s ADM Nòkwewashk should work with    partner departments to review and streamline the level of effort required to    support sustainable coordination. This should include a review of internal    tools and processes (e.g., frequency and mix of coordination products) to    reduce burden and provide a more holistic view of expected input and related timelines.</p></td>
<td><p><strong>Management response: </strong>Nòkwewashk    concurs with this recommendation, and has already taken steps to streamline    products, activities, and processes to reduce the workload burden on TMX    Partner Departments. <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Actions include: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In Spring 2022, Nòkwewashk undertook a    collaborative review of all coordination and communication products that    require interdepartmental input; as well as all interdepartmental governance    meetings. Representatives from the five TMX Partner Departments were asked to    rank each of the products and meetings based on their overall effectiveness    at supporting coordinated implementation. On the basis of this collaborative    review, products have either been maintained, reduced in scope or frequency,    or discontinued. Similarly, this review led to the consolidation of several    recurring working level meetings in to one interdepartmental working group.<strong></strong></li>
<li>The result of this review was a simplified but    comprehensive governance structure; and a reduced list of effective interdepartmental    products that will be carried forward.<strong></strong></li>
<li>Nòkwewashk will repeat this exercise every    fiscal year in collaboration with TMX Partner Departments, with an aim to    only maintain coordination and communication products and governance meetings    that are the most effective at supporting coordinated implementation. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Position responsible: </strong>Manager, TMX    Implementation</p>
<p><strong>Timing: </strong>Review of products to take place annually, at    the end of each fiscal year to program sunset. Final review expected by April    1, 2025.<strong></strong></p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p><strong>Recommendation 2.</strong> To increase their utility, NRCan’s ADM    Nòkwewashk should work with partner departments to refine and strengthen the    federal government’s approach to external communications on TMX Phase IV    implementation. This would include clearer delineation of roles and    responsibilities and process improvements that result in more timely and    tailored communications, particularly for Indigenous groups.</p></td>
<td><p><strong>Management response:</strong> Nòkwewashk    concurs with this recommendation, and will work to strengthen and refine    communications on TMX Implementation, within the constraints of its    significantly reduced capacity. Nòkwewashk will continue to provide    coordination support for future communications regarding the TMX initiatives    as a whole. TMX Partner Departments are responsible for proactive, two-way    communications with Indigenous groups regarding the individual initiatives    under their purview. </p>
<p><strong>Actions include: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Nòkwewashk will work with TMX Partner    Departments and Natural Resources Canada’s Communications and Portfolio    Sector to refine the federal government’s approach to communications,    including further streamlining approvals processes for communications products    under its purview (i.e., the TMX Website and the Indigenous Portal) to ensure    more timely and efficient updates. The revised communications approach will    include:
        <ul>
<li>Well delineated    roles, responsibilities, and accountabilities; </li>
<li>Mechanisms for    resolving disputes regarding content;</li>
<li>Clear, firm    timelines for input and approvals; and </li>
<li>Focus on    developing accessible, plain language content.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A full update of the TMX Website and Indigenous    Portal is planned to take place before March 31, 2023.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Position responsible: </strong>Manager, TMX    Implementation </p>
<p><strong>Timing: </strong>April 1, 2023<strong></strong></p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p><strong>Recommendation 3.</strong> NRCan’s ADM Nòkwewashk should revise its    approach to Indigenous engagement in ways that build trust and cultivate    meaningful relationships with Indigenous groups (e.g., frequent check-in    calls from engagement officers). This engagement should be more proactive and    include measures to mitigate the negative impact of staff turnover on    maintaining relationships.</p></td>
<td><p><strong>Management response: </strong>Nòkwewashk concurs    with this recommendation, and building trust and meaningful, and long-term    relationships with Indigenous groups is at the core of its mandate. Nòkwewashk    is in the process of establishing long-term, place-based mechanisms for    developing and strengthening these relationships that are not tied to    individual projects or programs. </p>
<p>Nòkwewashk will continue to conduct proactive engagement related to    TMX through existing mechanisms such as the TMX Indigenous Advisory and    Monitoring Committee. However, NRCan has limited resources to carry out its    role in coordinating post-decision implementation of TMX and its related    initiatives, and will no longer maintain its Phase IV Partnerships Office. Nòkwewashk’s    role in carrying out proactive engagement specifically related to the TMX    Project and associated initiatives through the Phase IV Partnerships Office    has been wound down in favour of broader, place-based, engagement focused on    long-term relationship-building. Nòkwewashk will continue to play an    important role in being supportive and responsive to Indigenous groups that    raise complex or cross-cutting issues related to the TMX Project. </p>
<p><strong>Actions include: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In Budget 2022, Nòkwewashk received funding to    expand the Indigenous Partnerships Office (IPO). The expansion of IPO is    focused on establishing ‘regional hubs’ of staff across Canada focused on    taking a place-based approach to building and sustaining relationships with    local Indigenous communities across Canada.</li>
<li>Nòkwewashk also received funding through Budget    2022 to continue to support the TMX Indigenous Advisory and Monitoring    Committee to facilitate a collaborative, inclusive, and transparent approach    to monitoring and oversight of TMX. </li>
<li>Nòkwewashk will continue to be responsive and    supportive to Indigenous groups regarding complex or cross-cutting issues    related to the TMX Project. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Position responsible: </strong>ADM Nòkwewashk, NRCan<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Timing: </strong>Actions will be ongoing. Review of progress    to date to be completed by April 1, 2025. <strong></strong></p></td>

<tr>
<td><p><strong>Recommendation 4.</strong> NRCan’s ADM Nòkwewashk should develop    performance metrics for TMX Phase IV implementation that are more meaningful    to Indigenous groups.</p></td>
<td><p><strong>Management response: </strong>Nòkwewashk concurs    with this recommendation, and has adjusted its performance indicators to    reflect its role in supporting ongoing Indigenous engagement related to TMX    implementation to the extent possible given the dedicated resources    available. <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Actions include: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>As part of its performance measurement strategy,    Nòkwewashk has adjusted its performance indicators to measure:<strong></strong></li>
<ul>
<li>Supportiveness    and responsiveness to Indigenous groups on TMX-related matters;<strong></strong></li>
<li>Ability to    support fulfillment of custom commitments to Indigenous groups made during    the Phase III consultations; and<strong></strong></li>
<li>Level of    satisfaction from Indigenous groups with the effectiveness of support    provided by Nòkwewashk during implementation.<strong></strong></li>

<h2 id="4">Introduction</h2>
<p>This document presents the findings, conclusions, and recommendations from an evaluation of the coordination structures supporting the Government of Canada’s post-decision implementation (Phase IV) of the Trans Mountain Expansion (TMX) project. The evaluation examined the design and effectiveness of these coordination structures from June 2019 to December 2021. </p>
<div class="well bg-success">
<p>The results of the evaluation will be used to inform program renewal. The evaluation’s findings and lessons learned may also be used to improve the coordination of TMX Phase IV implementation and to inform the federal government’s post-decision delivery of future major resource projects. </p>
</div>
<p>The evaluation responds to a Treasury Board (TB) commitment to complete an evaluation by March 2022.  NRCan's Audit and Evaluation Branch (AEB) undertook the evaluation between June 2021 and March 2022, with participation from partner departments and agencies engaged in the coordination of TMX Phase IV implementation. These include Canadian Coast Guard (CCG), Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC), Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO), and Transport Canada (TC). The evaluation also engaged with Indigenous groups involved in TMX to obtain their perspectives on relevance and effectiveness.</p>
<h3>Program Information</h3>
<p>The Trans Mountain Expansion project (the Project) will twin the existing Trans Mountain pipeline built in 1953, increasing the pipeline’s capacity from 300,000 to 890,000 barrels per day. It will follow existing rights of way for 89% of its 1,147-kilometre length. This project also expands the Westridge Marine Terminal in Burnaby, British Columbia. Construction of the twinned pipeline started in November 2019 and was expected to be completed mid- to late-2022 (now 2023). Box 1 presents a timeline of key events related to the Project that led to TMX Phase IV. </p>
<h4>Box 1: Timeline of Key Events from TMX Phase III Consultations to TMX Phase IV Implementation</h4>
<div class="well bg-success">
<p><strong>November 2016</strong> - The Government of Canada (GOC) approved the Project subject to 157 conditions imposed on the Trans Mountain Corporation (TMC; the Proponent).</p>
<p><strong>2016-2018</strong> - Indigenous groups, environmental groups, and municipalities challenged the Project decision by way of judicial review. </p>
<p><strong>August 2018</strong> - The Federal Court of Appeal quashed the November 2016 approval of the Project on the basis that the National Energy Board (NEB) (now Canadian Energy Regulator [CER]) erred in its decision and stated that Canada failed to discharge adequately its duty to consult in Phase III and in its decision to exclude marine shipping from the scope of its review.</p>
<p><strong>October 2018</strong> - The Government undertook a reconsideration process to further examine the potential impacts of marine shipping activities and re-initiated Phase III consultations, including approval of a mandate to consider accommodations.</p>
<p><strong>February 2019</strong> - The NEB [CER] submitted its <a href="https://www.cer-rec.gc.ca/en/applications-hearings/view-applications-projects/trans-mountain-expansion/reconsideration-report-trans-mountain-expansion-project.html">Reconsideration Report</a> for the Project, including 156 conditions directed at TMC and 16 recommendations directed at the GOC.  </p>
<p><strong>June 2019</strong> - Publication of the TMX <a href="https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/nrcan-rncan/site/tmx/TMX-CCAR_June2019-e-accessible.pdf">Crown Consultation and Accommodation Report</a>. PDF - 5.23 MB</p>
<p><strong>June 2019</strong> - The GOC re-approved the Project subject to 156 conditions imposed on TMC.</p>
</div>
<p>In June 2019, the TMX Project  decision was accompanied by a GOC commitment to implement eight accommodation  measures to address potential impacts to Indigenous rights and interests  identified during Phase III consultations, as well as respond to the Canada  Energy Regulator’s 16 recommendations to the GOC to mitigate or avoid potential  effects associated with the Project and related marine shipping (e.g., marine  safety, oil spill prevention and response, studies of terrestrial and  cumulative effects) and to build the capacity of and long-term relationships  with Indigenous peoples. There are 129 Indigenous groups eligible to access  some or all these accommodation measures, with specific eligibility based on  the 2019 Crown Consultation List for TMX.<sup id="fn1-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn1"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>1</a></sup> Additional bespoke commitments (unique to one or more Indigenous groups) were  also made during Phase III consultations that needed to be implemented. These initiatives are complex and multi-faceted, with  integrated roles and responsibilities linked to existing programs and  activities of more than seven federal departments and agencies. However, TMX  Phase IV implementation is not a horizontal initiative – i.e., individual  departments remain responsible and accountable for the delivery of the TMX  initiatives for which they are a lead (see Appendix 1).</p>
<p>Given this complexity, key objectives for federal  coordination of TMX Phase IV implementation were outlined in funding approvals  to include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ensuring the GOC is mobilized and has the  resources necessary to manage post-decision implementation throughout the  regulatory phase of the TMX Project, given the proponent's construction  schedule.</li>
<li>Engaging in meaningful post-decision phase  Indigenous engagement and continued involvement of Indigenous peoples  throughout post-decision activities.</li>
<li>Ensuring that the suite of accommodation  measures and responses to NEB [CER] recommendations are implemented in a  coordinated manner, and that the ongoing activities are being briefed on and  reported to appropriate bodies.</li>
</ol>
<h3><strong>Program Governance</strong></h3>
<p>The Minister of Natural Resources is the designated lead on the  coordination of TMX Phase IV Implementation. Implementation of related initiatives  is governed by the interdepartmental Deputy Minister Oversight TMX Committee  (DMOC), as well as the associated Assistant Deputy Ministers TMX Oversight  Committee (ADMOC) and Director General+ Coordinating Committee (DG+CC). While  the DMOC and ADMOC provide forums for strategic oversight and coordination  across whole-of-government, most decisions are now made at the level of DG+CC.</p>
<p>The GOC has funded two TMX coordination structures to  facilitate coordination on TMX Phase IV implementation, both led by NRCan:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Strategic Policy and Coordination Team - </strong>NRCan’s  Strategic Policy and Coordination Team (NRCan-SPC) is an internal-facing  coordination structure. Its purpose is to help partner departments navigate the  complexity surrounding the TMX Phase IV implementation and horizontal  coordination. NRCan-SPC has two key functions: (1) policy and coordination  (providing policy support on cross-cutting issues, tracking progress, ensuring  coordination amongst partner departments, coordinating public communications,  finding efficiencies in delivery, and supporting senior management oversight)  and (2) supporting and tracking regulatory authorizations, permitting and  construction.</li>
<li><strong>Phase IV  Partnership Office - </strong>NRCan’s Phase IV Partnership Office (NRCan-P4PO) is an  external-facing coordination structure. Its purpose is to play an active role  in coordinating and triaging the Crown's outreach efforts to mitigate  engagement fatigue within Indigenous groups. NRCan-P4PO is responsible for  engaging in dialogue related to the accommodation measures and custom commitments  made during Phase III and Phase IV, as well as for tracking progress on their  implementation by partner departments.</li>
</ol>
<p>Since 2019, these two TMX coordination structures have reported  to the Assistant Deputy Minister (ADM) of NRCan’s Nòkwewashk sector.<sup id="fn2-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn2"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>2</a></sup> To the end of fiscal year 2021-22, this reporting was via the Director General  (DG) of TMX Policy. Following a sector re-organization, these two functions are  now part of two separate branches within Nòkwewashk, reporting to the DG of the  Regulatory Coordination, Consultation and Economic Inclusion Branch. Each  partner department has also established its own TMX Secretariat to support  departmental coordination, supported by this overarching governance model. </p>
<p>While most TMX Phase IV initiatives are led by partner  departments, NRCan is also responsible, in whole or in part, for two  accommodation measures and two CER recommendations that it implements  separately from the coordination function. The performance of these initiatives  is not included in the scope of this evaluation.</p>
<h3><strong>Program Resources</strong></h3>
<p>Funding allocated in original funding approvals to government capacity and administration for the coordination of TMX is shown in Table 1. Total incremental funding allocated undertake this work is $31.6M over three to five years. This does not include funding allocations to specific accommodation measures (see Appendix 1).</p>

<h3><strong>Expected Results</strong></h3>
<p>Coordination of TMX Phase IV implementation is linked to the  Resource Partnerships Sector Program under NRCan’s Core Responsibility for  ‘Globally Competitive Natural Resource Sectors’ in its Departmental Results  Framework. This Core Responsibility aims to advance and promote market access,  inclusiveness, and competitiveness for Canada’s natural resource sectors, in  support of jobs and economic growth. This includes supporting participation of  Indigenous groups, organizations, or governments in Canada’s natural resource  economy. From 2019 to 2021, working to construct and complete the twinning of  the Trans Mountain Pipeline was also among the mandate letter commitments of  the Minister of Natural Resources, anchored in commitments to protect and  create jobs, create economic opportunities for Indigenous communities and use  revenues to finance Canada’s clean energy transition.</p>
<p>Expected results for the coordination of TMX Phase IV  implementation were outlined in the initiative’s funding approvals. These include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Fulfill the Government of Canada's  commitments to the public and Indigenous Peoples for the implementation of  TMX-related initiatives.</li>
<li>Ensure whole-of-government coordination  between departments on the delivery of initiatives.</li>
<li>Mobilize existing governance structures  (created during Phase III) to optimize existing networks and improve  implementation efficiency.</li>
<li>Support Indigenous groups to facilitate  their access to opportunities related to TMX initiatives.</li>
<li>Monitor and facilitate reporting on  progress.</li>
</ol>
<p>There was no logic model guiding the implementation of the  initiative given its administrative focus and expected short duration. To  support our analysis, the evaluation team developed a logic model for the  coordination of TMX Phase IV implementation based on the above noted objectives  and expected results (see Figure 1).</p>
<h4>Figure 1: Logic Model for the TMX-Phase IV Coordination</h4>
<p><a href="/sites/nrcan/files/AEB/Figure 1 - Logic Model for the TMX-Phase IV Coordination - ENGLISH(2).JPG"><img alt="Graphic" class="img-responsive center-block img-thumbnail" src="/sites/nrcan/files/AEB/Figure 1 - Logic Model for the TMX-Phase IV Coordination - ENGLISH(2).JPG"/></a><br/>
<details><summary>Text Description</summary>
<p>Infographic showing  the Logic Model for the TMX Phase IV Coordination.</p>
<p>The logic model shows the relationships between the inputs,  activities, outputs, reach / participants, immediate outcomes, intermediate  outcomes, and the overarching TMX ultimate outcome for the three components of  the TMX Phase IV Coordination: P4PO, SPC’s policy and coordination function, as  well as SPC’s regulatory authorizations, permitting and construction function. </p>
<p>For each of the three components, solid arrows point from  “inputs” to “activities” to “outputs” to “reach / participants”, indicating  direct influences of the TMX-Phase IV Coordination. Then, dashed arrows point  from “reach / participants” to “immediate outcomes” to “intermediate outcomes”  to the overarching “TMX ultimate outcome”, indicating indirect influences of the  TMX Phase IV Coordination.</p>
<p>Inputs for TMX Phase IV Coordination includes funding over  27 months (2019-2022), which includes NRCan ($22.1M), DFO ($8.7M), CCG ($5.10M)  and TC ($0.3M in O &amp; M; $1.5M in G&amp; Cs), and TMX secretariats of OGDs.</p>
<p>For P4PO:</p>
<ul>
<li>Activities include P4PO operates as a ‘‘single  window’’ for Indigenous engagement. </li>

<h2 id="5">Evaluation Objectives and Methods  </h2>
<p>Led by NRCan’s Evaluation Division, the evaluation functions  of implicated partner departments collaborated to develop an evaluation  approach for TMX Phase IV Implementation. The resulting approach was brought to  the TMX ADM and DM Oversight Committees for concurrence in 2019. As per that  approach, this evaluation was led by NRCan’s Evaluation Division with input of  partner departments coordinated through an interdepartmental Evaluation  Steering Committee. </p>
<h3><strong>Evaluation Objectives  and Scope</strong></h3>
<p>The objectives of this evaluation are:</p>
<ol>
<li>To  assess the extent to which NRCan’s TMX coordination structures have been  implemented as planned and can demonstrate progress towards intended results.</li>
<li>Given  results achieved to date and status of implementation, to assess the ongoing  relevance of NRCan’s P4PO and SPC teams.</li>
<li>To  identify and document lessons learned from early implementation that can be  used to improve the performance of these functions and/or be applied to future  interventions.</li>
</ol>
<p>The evaluation focused on NRCan's design and delivery of coordination  for TMX Phase IV implementation from June 2019 to December 2021. The evaluation  considered the activities of partner departments in facilitating the intended  results of these coordinating structures to the extent that it impacted  performance but excludes functions of these departments for Phase IV which  extend beyond coordination (e.g., DFO’s enhanced regulatory review process for  TMX). </p>
<p>The performance of specific TMX initiatives, including those  led by NRCan, was excluded from the scope of the evaluation. Some will be  subject to separate evaluations according to the overall TMX evaluation  approach and the internal evaluation plans of lead departments. The scope of  this evaluation also excludes activities that took place during earlier phases  of TMX (e.g., Phase III consultations). </p>
<p>Given its stage of implementation, it was not possible to  fully assess the intermediate or ultimate outcomes of this coordination on TMX  Phase IV implementation. The evaluation focused on progress towards immediate  outcomes and the extent to which risks identified during program design had  been effectively mitigated.</p>
<p>A Gender-Based Analysis Plus (GBA+) completed by the program  recognized the importance of a distinctions-based, tailored approach to  Indigenous engagement and that major resource projects as currently designed  perpetuate an imbalanced relationship between the Crown and Indigenous peoples,  as well as being a source of gender-specific issues (e.g., gender violence and  socioeconomic challenges). Gender-specific issues are not part of the scope of  this evaluation; however, the extent to which this broader context may inform  lessons learned in the design and implementation of TMX Phase IV or other major  resource projects were considered as part of the evaluation analysis.</p>
<h3><strong>Evaluation Questions and  Considerations </strong></h3>
<p>The evaluation  addressed these objectives by responding to the following evaluation questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>To what  extent are mechanisms to coordinate the Government of Canada’ implementation  and delivery of post-decision activities established and operating as planned?</li>
<li>Are NRCan’s  P4PO and SPC teams achieving  expected results? For whom? Why or why not?
      <ol class="lst-lwr-alph">
<li>How  effective is NRCan-P4PO in facilitating post-decision phase Indigenous  engagement and continued involvement of Indigenous peoples throughout  post-decision activities? </li>
<li>How  effective is NRCan-SPC in facilitating the coordinated and efficient  implementation and delivery of post-decision activities? </li>
<li>What  has facilitated or impeded the effectiveness and efficiency of these coordination  structures for the Government of Canada? For Indigenous groups? Other partners  and stakeholders?</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Is  there an ongoing need for NRCan’s P4PO and/or SPC teams?
    <ol class="lst-lwr-alph">
<li>If yes,  what would be their respective roles and who should be responsible?</li>
<li>Have  there been areas of activity or duplication that should be streamlined? </li>
<li>What  would be the alternative(s)? </li>
</ol></li>
<li>What  lessons have been learned from early implementation of these coordinating  structures that can be used to improve the performance of these functions and/or  applied to future interventions?</li>
</ol>
<p>The evaluation was  designed with consideration of the program’s information needs, risk and  complexity, including GBA+ considerations. Given the objectives of TMX Phase  IV, the evaluation design recognized a need to capture Indigenous groups’  perspectives on relevance and effectiveness. This met some limitations during  data collection (see evaluation limitations). </p>
<p>The coordination of TMX Phase IV implementation has not been  previously evaluated. However, there are a number of past reviews related to management  of major projects, horizontal federal coordination and Indigenous engagement  that were useful to inform lessons learned for this evaluation.</p>
<h3><strong>Evaluation Methods</strong></h3>
<p>The approach and  methodology used for this evaluation followed the TB <em>Policy on Results</em> (2016)  and related <em>Standards on Evaluation</em>. The evaluation used four lines of  evidence (Figure 2).</p>
<h4>Figure 2: The Evaluation’s Four Lines of Evidence</h4>
<div class="well bg-success">
<div class="row">
<div class="col-sm-3">
<h4>Key Informant Interviews</h4>
<p>Virtual interviews (n=17) were conducted with 28 federal key informants, including senior leaders (n=14; 5 of 14 from NRCan) and program staff (n=14) responsible for the coordination and/or implementation of TMX Phase IV. </p>
<p>Interviews were used to obtain senior level viewpoints on all evaluation questions.</p>
<p>Proponent insights were obtained via two additional interviews with representatives of TMC (n=3).</p>
</div>
<div class="col-sm-3">
<h4>Document Review</h4>
<p>Internal and public documents related to the design and performance (e.g., TB submissions, records of decision, program tools, etc.) were reviewed.</p>
<p>These documents were used to facilitate the examination of the program's design and delivery, as well as early outcomes achievement.</p>
</div>
<div class="col-sm-3">
<h4>GOC Survey</h4>
<p>An online survey of federal engagement leads and departmental coordinators from NRCan and partner departments (n=28; 64.3% response rate) was conducted. </p>
<p>The survey provided viewpoints on the extent to which coordination efforts are perceived as relevant and effective at the working level. </p>
</div>
<div class="col-sm-3">
<h4>Indigenous Engagement</h4>
<p>The evaluation offered Indigenous groups various means to share their perspectives (Appendix 2). </p>
<p>The evaluation received input from 12 of 30 groups in a target sample (40% response rate) via virtual interviews and e-mailed responses. </p>
<p>One interviewee was a consultant representing a First Nation; the remainder were members of the Indigenous group for which they responded.</p>
<p>Indigenous perspectives were particularly informative on the effectiveness of NRCan-P4PO in Indigenous engagement.</p>

<h2 id="6">Evaluation Limitations and Mitigation Strategies</h2>
<p>The evaluation used a mixed-method approach with multiple  lines of evidence to mitigate against any limitations associated with  individual methods. This enabled the triangulation of evidence across sources  of information to identify valid findings and draw evidence-based conclusions.  However, the following key limitations should be considered when reviewing the evaluation  findings. Additional limitations are referenced where relevant throughout this  report.</p>
<p><strong>Key Informant Interviews and GOC Survey. </strong>While a  small number of interviewees declined to participate (n=4), interviews were  sufficiently comprehensive to be considered representative of the perceptions  of senior managers in NRCan and partner departments. Similarly, there was an  adequate response rate for the survey of federal engagement leads and  departmental coordinators. However, staff turnover at all levels within NRCan and  across partner departments since 2019 means that not all federal key informants  were fully familiar with the original intended design of coordination structures  for TMX Phase IV.</p>
<p><strong>Document Review.</strong> Sufficient documentation was  available to inform the evaluation but some information that would have been  useful to inform analysis has not been retained. For example, NRCan has not  kept a record of all changes in its TMX organizational structure since 2019 or  the transitory input of partner departments used to update key tools and  processes. Internal reviews (e.g., stock-taking exercise) were in progress but  results were not yet available at the time of analysis to inform the  evaluation. </p>
<p><strong>Indigenous Engagement. </strong>Indigenous engagement stood  alone in evaluation design as a separate method to ensure that it received the  proper focus. The evaluation team engaged a consultant with expertise in Indigenous  engagement from the Kelly-Sears Consulting Group<sup id="fn3-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn3"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>3</a></sup> to advise on the engagement  approach and lead the conduct of interviews with Indigenous key informants. The evaluation aimed to collect input from  a minimum of 30 Indigenous groups (23.3% of the 129 on the Crown  Consultation List for TMX). Using a random and targeted sample, the evaluation  reached out to 64 Indigenous groups (49.6% of the 129). Despite best efforts  (see Appendix 2), the evaluation only received input from representatives in 12  Indigenous groups (9.3% of the 129 or 40% of the evaluation’s target). Particularly  given the known lack of homogeneity within this group of respondents, findings  from Indigenous engagement can not be generalized across all 129 Indigenous groups.  However, there was generally a high level of agreement in perspectives shared across  responses.</p>
<h2 id="7">What We Found: Planned vs Actual Delivery</h2>
<div class="well bg-success">
<h3><strong>Summary of Key Findings: </strong></h3>
<p>The evaluation found that the Government of Canada has  established suitable governance mechanisms and coordination structures to  coordinate the Crown’s implementation and delivery of the TMX-Phase IV activities  and that these were all operational in 2019. While the roles fulfilled have  been relatively well defined and consistent, the organizational structure and  titles associated with NRCan’s TMX coordination structures have changed  frequently over time to account for evolving roles. </p>
<p>TMX  coordination structures were structured and operating as planned, with one key  exception – NRCan-P4PO has not fully fulfilled its intended role as a true  “single window” for Indigenous engagement. For various reasons, including  a need to support ongoing accountability in delivery of G&amp;C programs, partner departments have developed or  maintained their own relationships and are interacting directly with Indigenous  groups. Notwithstanding  this approach, NRCan-P4PO is still perceived by most respondents to play an  important role in management of unique issues that are more sensitive or  complex and in cross-departmental coordination.</p>
<p>The workload related to TMX coordination is not perceived as  sustainable by partner departments. Each department is accountable for the TMX  Phase IV initiative(s) it leads, and reports on this through their own  governance structures as well as interdepartmentally. Partner departments  report having underestimated the level of effort that would be required for  coordination and reporting.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 1:</strong>  NRCan’s ADM Nòkwewashk  should work with partner departments to review and streamline the level of  effort required to support sustainable coordination. This should include a review of internal tools and processes  (e.g., frequency and mix of coordination products) to reduce burden and provide  a more holistic view of expected input and related timelines. </p>
</div>
<p>Timely and effective  establishment of mechanisms to coordinate the Government of Canada’s  implementation and delivery of post-decision activities, including for  engagement with Indigenous groups, was a key activity identified in funding  approvals for TMX Phase IV implementation. The evaluation examined the extent  to which these mechanisms were established and operating as planned. </p>
<h3><strong>The Government of  Canada has established governance mechanisms to coordinate its implementation  and delivery of the TMX Project. </strong></h3>
<p>Governance structures are a key component of the coordinated  federal approach. For TMX Phase IV, the GOC expected to mobilize existing  governance structures (created during Phase III) to optimize existing networks  and improve implementation efficiency. This includes DMOC, which was established  as part of Phase III Consultations for the Project, and the associated ADMOC. Analysis of  program documents confirms that the GOC maintained these two governance  committees and established a third, DG and Director- level committee (DG+CC) to  further coordinate its implementation and delivery of post-decision activities. </p>
<p>The GOC expected these governance committees to meet  frequently over at least the first three years of implementation to discuss  issues related to implementation and delivery. As shown in Figure 3, the actual  number of meetings exceeded performance targets in the first year but has since  been reduced.<sup id="fn4-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn4"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>4</a></sup> NRCan-TMX program staff indicated that while intensive governance was required  early on, the need for decision-making from senior management reduced as  implementation proceeded. Federal key informants (including senior members of  the DMOC and ADMOC) from all  departments perceived the number of meetings to be sufficient. The DG+CC  also continues to meet regularly.</p>

<h3><strong>The NRCan-TMX  coordination structures were established and operational in 2019.</strong></h3>
<p>Documents show that Phase IV Partnerships Office was established  and became operational in 2019, with the first of numerous communications from NRCan-P4PO  to Indigenous groups in September 2019. While narrowly missing its staffing  target (with 14 positions staffed by 13 FTEs), this performance exceeds NRCan’s  target to have NRCan-P4PO established and fully staffed (with 15 FTEs) by March  2020. Evidence also indicates that over this period NRCan-P4PO developed and  implemented many of the tools and processes required to support its work (e.g.,  working groups, including one specific to engagement). By necessity,  NRCan-P4PO’s communication approach changed significantly with the onset of the  COVID-19 pandemic but interactions with Indigenous groups continued.</p>
<p>An NRCan team responsible for whole-of-government  coordination on TMX Phase IV implementation, now referred to as the Strategic  Policy and Coordination Team, was also established and has been operational  since 2019. Some of NRCan-SPC’s key tools (e.g., TMX Phase IV Calendar) were  developed and populated as early as June 2019, with working groups and other  key tools and processes implemented in fall 2019. A Regulatory Permitting and  Authorization (RAP) function was also created and later subsumed under NRCan-SPC.  While NRCan-SPC’s mandate was consistent with the envisioned plan, the team has  leaner staff than initially planned (i.e., 9 vs 15 FTEs). </p>
<p>NRCan senior managers perceived the NRCan-TMX coordination  structures to be adequately resourced. However, key informants from both the  federal government and the TMC noted a high level of turnover in staff across  coordination structures over the period of implementation. There are  indications that staff turnover has had an impact on planned operations, most  importantly in the context of building and maintaining relationships in an  interdepartmental project that involves extensive engagement with Indigenous  peoples. </p>
<h3><strong>The  structures and roles of NRCan’s TMX coordination structures align with planned design  but have changed frequently over time to account for evolving roles. </strong></h3>
<p>The roles and responsibilities of NRCan’s TMX coordination  structures are well documented, with key responsibilities for both NRCan-SPC  and NRCan-P4PO clearly outlined by January 2020. The responsibilities outlined generally  align with and add to roles as described in funding approvals. </p>
<p>Key  informants in NRCan and all partner departments indicated a common  understanding of the role of NRCan’s TMX coordination structures. They  described NRCan as having a crucial role central to whole-of-government  coordination. As it is not the lead department on implementing most  accommodation measures or CER recommendations, NRCan’s role is not to dictate  how initiatives should be implemented but instead provide oversight, strategic  direction, and policy support on cross-cutting issues and to ensure  coordination between departments and agencies as they navigate the complexity  surrounding Phase IV implementation. This includes working to ensure consistent  messaging and avoiding unnecessary burden for Indigenous groups. Funding  approvals outline the specific role of NRCan-P4PO as shown in Figure 4. </p>

The Whole-of-Government Coordination includes: coordinate Indigenous engagement from a whole-of-government perspective; coordinate whole-of-government resolution of outstanding Project-related concerns; and connect with partner departments to respond to Indigenous groups’ priorities and concerns.</p>
</details></p>
<p>While  the roles fulfilled have been relatively well defined and consistent, the  organizational structure and titles associated with NRCan’s TMX coordination  structures have changed frequently.<sup id="fn5-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn5"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>5</a></sup> Federal key informants generally agreed that implementation of TMX Phase IV  coordination structures has been iterative, explaining that these have  appropriately evolved as the program has matured over time. </p>
<p>All  departments agreed that the NRCan-TMX coordination structures were operating as  planned, with one key exception. One of the key objectives of TMX Phase IV  Implementation is to engage meaningfully with Indigenous groups, which funding  approvals indicate was to be facilitated by a “single window” approach to  engagement led by NRCan-P4PO. This single window would manage the breadth and  spectrum of initiatives that involve Indigenous consultations; connect with  federal partner organizations to respond to questions from Indigenous groups;  and provide timely and informed advice. While respondents from all departments indicated that a “single window”  was well intended and/or a good concept, evidence indicates that NRCan-P4PO has not  fully fulfilled this role. For various reasons, partner  departments still mostly engage with Indigenous groups directly rather than  through NRCan-P4PO (see Box 2). </p>
<h4>Box 2:  Reasons for Partner Departments’ Direct Indigenous Engagement</h4>
<div class="well bg-success">
<p>Partner  departments have developed or maintained their own relationships and are  interacting directly with Indigenous groups.  Reasons for this were reported to include: </p>
<ul>
<li>Partner departments that had pre-existing processes  and relationships with (certain) Indigenous groups as a result of other  departmental initiatives did not perceive a need for or a benefit from support  from NRCan-P4PO. </li>
<li>Each department is responsible for the delivery of its  own accommodations. Coordination is complicated given differences in the design  of accommodation measures; each is moving at its own pace and engages different  sets of Indigenous groups. Once into the details of co-development or  implementation of accommodation measures, the departments with technical  knowledge and direct decision-making need to be directly engaged. Time to  deliver accommodations is limited and partner departments do not want to be  delayed (i.e., bilateral engagement is quicker than multilateral engagement). </li>
<li>Developing a relationship with those who provide the  program or service, not the coordinators, was also seen as important from the  perspective of ongoing accountability in delivery. In some cases, Indigenous groups  may also prefer this direct engagement.</li>
<li>There was some indication of  mistrust in how adeptly NRCan-P4PO would represent the position of OGDs.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Key informants from TMC also indicated some duplication of  Indigenous engagement activities and support provided to Indigenous groups  between TMC and P4PO. Prior to Phase IV, TMC also already had their own  agreements and long-standing relationships with Indigenous groups to support the  latter in navigating the Project. Building off existing relationships, some  Indigenous partners would thus first turn to the TMC Indigenous engagement team  with specific questions on accommodation measures. Given TMC is not responsible  for these accommodations, it would then organize phone calls or meetings  between Indigenous groups and NRCan-P4PO. Nevertheless, the relationships  between TMC and NRCan-P4PO were perceived to be mutually supportive, e.g., with  instances where TMC has proactively invited NRCan-P4PO to participate in its workshops  with Indigenous groups (and vice versa). </p>
<p>Regardless,  NRCan-P4PO is still perceived by most respondents to play an important  coordination, if not engagement function. Several respondents (including in  TMC) also noted the important functions that NRCan-P4PO plays as a “concierge  service” (facilitating  difficult conversations or resolution of more challenging/cross-cutting issues)  or  “relationship broker”  (assisting Indigenous groups in navigating accommodation measures and related  governance), noting that it could otherwise be chaotic for Indigenous groups to  navigate the accommodation measures. </p>
<p>A  few departments’ key informants also indicated that at the outset there was  insufficient focus on CER recommendations. While now being corrected,  this issue has resulted in a perceived lack of understanding of how some of these  recommendations contribute to related accommodation measures.</p>
<h3><strong>The workload  related to TMX coordination is not perceived as sustainable by partner  departments. </strong></h3>
<p>In addition to interdepartmental  reporting, each department also reports on the TMX Phase IV initiative it leads  through its own TMX Secretariat and governance structures. NRCan perceives interactions with these structures to be  effective and efficient, as this enables strong lines of communication between  NRCan and partner departments. However, key informants in all partner  departments report having underestimated the level of effort that would be  required for coordination and reporting. While management of major projects is  familiar within the mandate of these OGDs, NRCan’s coordination on TMX Phase IV  represents an extra layer of administration that they are not used to on major  projects. The related workload is perceived to be taxing on internal resources<strong>.</strong></p>

<p>Working- and senior-level federal key informants noted that coordination on TMX creates constant demands to deliver on tight timelines, which puts pressure on the limited capacity in partner departments. Survey participants were asked about the sustainability of the current approach to government coordination given the capacity (resources and workload) of NRCan and partner departments. While no respondents indicated that the current approach was fully sustainable (Figure 5), the perceived impact of this demand varies among the departments (Table 2). Respondents from NRCan, TC and ECCC were the most positive about sustainability. While feedback from DFO was also less positive, only in CCG did the majority (60%) perceive the approach to be unsustainable. Comments indicate that this is attributed, in part, to tight turnaround time in reporting demands. The high level of turnover and need to bring new staff up to speed, including within NRCan-SPC, may contribute to these perceptions.</p>

<td><p>ECCC    received resources for project coordination via a transfer of Vote 1 from DFO.    According to ECCC informants, a portion of this funding is used to run a    small Secretariat (4 FTEs) that they perceive to be efficient. One ECCC senior    manager indicated that more resources would be preferable (1-2 FTEs).</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p><strong>TC</strong></p></td>
<td><p>TC senior management    perceived that the funding it was allocated was relatively lean. TC has drawn    on other resources and sources of funding to support the department’s role and    alleviate year over year financial pressures, including TMX-IAMC funding as    well departmental surplus. One interviewee suggested that one FTE does the    job of three individuals. While interviewees mentioned that more resources    are required, they did not specify the amount. </p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p><strong>DFO</strong></p></td>
<td><p>DFO    sought Capacity and Administration funding to cover multiple areas of work to    support Phase IV implementation, including but not limited to interdepartmental    coordination. The bulk of this funding was directed to support a dedicated    TMX regulatory review unit as well as leading the implementation of    Recommendations 5&amp;6 within DFO, with additional funds to support other    departmental programs anticipated to have an increased workload as a result    of TMX (e.g., of total funds, $1.07M to DFO Legal Services Unit and $1.82M to    DFO Science, Oceans Management and Fisheries and Harbour Management to    facilitate the implementation of TMX). </p>
<p>Within    DFO, coordination responsibilities fall under a dedicated TMX Regulatory    Review team in Pacific Region (2 FTEs) along with the Major Projects Division    in the National Capital Region (2 FTEs). While this is consistent with    intended design, given the volume of work to support interdepartmental    coordination, DFO drew some resources allocated to accommodations to further    support coordination. DFO also reorganized to place coordination directly    under the Associate Regional Director General, Pacific Region to ensure focused    senior management attention on the file. </p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p><strong>CCG</strong></p></td>
<td><p>CCG interviewees estimated    that it had created 3-4 FTEs to coordinate administration with NRCan. Again, given    the volume of work to support interdepartmental coordination, funding    allocated for coordination was deemed insufficient and CCG had to take    resources from the implementation of other initiatives to support this    coordination.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Overall, partner departments reported not being sufficiently resourced for coordination. As shown in Figure 6, evidence indicates that NRCan, DFO and CCG underspent funding allocated for coordination and administration (and for DFO, to support regulatory review). Overall, NRCan spent 69.3% of its planned budget for coordination of TMX Phase IV, while DFO spent 62.2% and CCG spent 70%. ECCC’s total expenditures were more or less as planned (99.5% of planned budget), overspending by 3% in just one of the three fiscal years. By contrast, TC’s expenditures represented 123.4% of its planned budget. Where lapses did occur, available financial data indicate that these were largely in terms of expenditures on operations and maintenance (O&amp;M). NRCan and partner departments explained that lapses were caused by factors such as COVID-19, with funds not being directed to planned activities such as travel and the hiring of contractors, as well as staff turnover. NRCan also underspent the $1.5M in G&amp;Cs it received to support Indigenous groups’ participation in engagement and consultation activities (see Box 6).</p>

<h2 id="8">What We Found: Effectiveness of the Strategic Policy and Coordination Team</h2>
<div class="well bg-success">
<h3><strong>Summary of Key Findings:</strong></h3>
<p>Overall, we found that NRCan-SPC has  created effective tools and processes to support federal coordination. However,  the processes used to create and update these products were less effective.  Engagement leads and departmental coordinators perceived that the processes are  often rushed, inconsistent or duplicative in their reporting, and underestimate  the amount of time required for input and approval. Respondents suggested that  more predictability or advance notice of requests and expected service  standards could help improve the process, as could more effectively leveraging  tools and processes from interrelated federal initiatives.</p>
<p>While NRCan-SPC  coordination has enabled efficiencies in some areas, improvements are still  required for existing mechanisms to ease the flow of information. Our observations  relating to NRCan-SPC’s specific activities are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Progress Reporting to Governance Bodies. </strong>Overall,<strong> </strong>progress reporting to governance bodies is effective and key governance  bodies (i.e., ADMOC and DMOC) are well supported. However, federal key  informants perceived that DG+CC could be more effective. A lack of strong  participation from partner departments may be limiting its effectiveness.</li>
<li><strong>Strategic  Oversight and Direction. </strong>Strategic direction and oversight provided were  perceived to be effective by senior federal respondents but ineffective by most  (67%) of those at the working level. Most respondents indicated that efficiency  of tools and supporting processes could be improved. Nevertheless, while  consensus on decisions was not always possible, NRCan-SPC is perceived to be  open and transparent in working to resolve cross-cutting issues in the face of  divergent views.</li>
<li><strong>Consistent Messaging.</strong> NRCan-SPC was  overall perceived by interviewees to be effective in influencing consistent  messaging, although some key information products were significantly delayed  (including those delivered by NRCan-P4PO). There is also a perceived lack of  clear delineation between the activities related to “communication” versus  “engagement”, and who is responsible for each.</li>
<li><strong>Regulatory  Coordination.</strong> NRCan-SPC was generally perceived as being effective in  fulfilling its intended regulatory permitting and authorization function.  Respondents from TMC noted that they were not entirely satisfied with the speed  of regulatory approvals but acknowledged that NRCan helped facilitate and  expedite this process (along with key decision makers in DFO and ECCC). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recommendation 2:</strong> To increase their utility, NRCan’s ADM Nòkwewashk  should work with partner departments to  refine and strengthen the federal government’s approach to external communications  on TMX Phase IV implementation. This would include clearer delineation of roles  and responsibilities and process improvements that result in more timely and  tailored communications, particularly for Indigenous groups. </p>
</div>
<p>The evaluation  examined the extent to which NRCan-SPC and the mechanisms it has put in place  were effective in facilitating a coordinated and efficient implementation and  delivery of post-decision activities, including integrated, whole-of-government  oversight and reporting.</p>
<h3><strong>NRCan-SPC has created  effective tools and processes to support federal coordination and Indigenous  engagement. </strong></h3>
<p>Given their importance to maintaining and finding  efficiencies in whole-of-government collaboration in the delivery of TMX initiatives,  NRCan set a target for NRCan-SPC to establish minimum of four reporting tools  and coordination mechanisms by March 2020.The evaluation found that NRCan-SPC  exceeded this performance target with more than 10 tools and processes to  support federal coordination developed and implemented since 2019. These tools  included a Whole of Government Working Group, weekly updates, initiative leave  behinds and work plans/accommodation dashboards, which were all in place by  March 2020. Each tool and process has its own, stand-alone purpose.</p>
<p>NRCan also set an initial target that the five responsible departments  (including NRCan) would provide regular input into each tool/process (at a  minimum, quarterly). The department later acknowledged that quarterly updates  are not feasible for all products and proposed that the frequency of input be  revised to at minimum, annually. These updates involve transitory information. Although  input records were not available for most tools and processes in NRCan’s  repository, program staff and federal key informants indicated that partners  have been active in providing updates specific to their departments. Therefore,  while not conclusive, available evidence suggests that the performance target  was met.</p>
<p>Federal key informants from most departments generally perceived  that these tools and processes provide a systematic, consistent, and comparable  approach to obtain basic information (e.g., status of implementation and  funding). However, these perspectives differed somewhat between senior and  working level staff. Results of the survey of engagement leads and departmental  coordinators are shown in Figure 7. Survey respondents generally agreed that  most of NRCan-SPC’s tools or processes were effective in facilitating  coordination across departments and agencies. Those used to provide internal  updates and discuss cross-cutting issues – e.g., the accommodation dashboards,  and the funding tracker – were all perceived to be somewhat or very effective  by most respondents (≥50%). The only tool or process perceived to be  ineffective was the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/campaign/trans-mountain/what-is-tmx.html">TMX website</a>. In general, feedback  from departmental coordinators was more positive compared to engagement leads. Respondents  from TC were also more positive relative to all other partner departments.</p>

<p>By contrast, senior level federal key informants perceived  that the DG+CC could be more effective. While this committee was perceived to  be an essential forum for discussing and resolving important issues, some  respondents indicated that a lack of strong participation from partner  departments in providing input may be limiting its effectiveness. Further,  these informants suggested that insufficient discussion at the working level  and the late distribution of material made it difficult to engage in a  meaningful way. NRCan has started to address this issue through informal  meetings with counterparts in partner departments to identify where better  support and clearer direction is required.</p>
<p>For other tools and processes, negative perceptions among  both senior and working level staff were explained to relate less to the  quality of products and more to the effectiveness of the process used to create  these products. Engagement leads and departmental coordinators explained that  the processes are often perceived to be rushed, inconsistent in their  reporting, and underestimate the amount of time required for response. Survey  and interview findings revealed challenges in obtaining input and approval, IT  limitations to share the tools/processes across departments, and duplication of  efforts due to the additions of working groups and committees. Respondents  suggested that more predictability or advance notice of requests and expected  service standards could help improve the process. Federal key informants from a  few departments also suggested that more effectively leveraging tools and  processes from existing or previous initiatives (e.g., Oceans Protection Plan)  could have increased efficiency. </p>
<h3><strong>Overall, federal  respondents perceived NRCan-SPC as effective in achieving its intended purpose.</strong></h3>
<p>Funding approvals for TMX Phase IV implementation indicate  that NRCan-SPC had planned to complete an annual survey of engagement leads and  departmental coordinators to inform its performance metrics related to  effectiveness of coordination. However, at the start of this evaluation (May  2021), NRCan-SPC indicated that such a survey had yet to be completed. The  evaluation team thus worked with program representatives on the design of the  evaluation’s survey to ensure that it would also meet these information needs.</p>
<p>The evaluation’s survey results show that most engagement  leads and departmental coordinators perceive that NRCan-SPC was effective in  fulfilling its intended purpose (Figure 8).<sup id="fn6-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn6"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>6</a></sup> Engagement leads were less positive  than departmental coordinators; those from DFO and ECCC gave more negative  feedback compared with those in other partner departments.</p>

<p>The evaluation’s findings related to the effectiveness of  NRCan-SPC can be further broken down against each of its key areas of activity:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Progress Reporting  to Governance Bodies.</strong> This  activity was perceived to be the most effective by respondents at all levels.  Federal key informants perceived that key governance bodies, specifically ADMOC  and DMOC, were well supported and have a good flow of information. Progress  reports, products, and issues updates provided to the governance bodies were  perceived to be well-organized and consistent. Federal key informants at the  most senior levels (i.e., DM and ADMs) felt that NRCan was proactive in  addressing their information needs.</li>
<li><strong>Strategic Oversight  and Direction. </strong>Strategic direction  and oversight provided were perceived to be effective by senior federal  respondents but ineffective by most (67%) of those at the working level. Most  respondents indicated that efficiency of tools and supporting processes could  be improved. Nevertheless, federal  key informants agreed that NRCan-SPC has established strong lines of  communication with partner departments and is effectively working to develop  consistency on cross-cutting issues in the face of divergent views. While  consensus on decisions was not always possible (see Box 3), they stressed the  importance of open discussion and transparency in decision-making.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Box 3:  An Example of Challenges in Resolving Cross-cutting Policy Issues</h3>
<div class="well bg-success">
<p>NRCan-SPC led the development  of a whole-of-government approach to engaging with an Indigenous community that  was listed on the TMX Crown Consultation List, but that Canada does not  consider to holding recognized s. 35 rights under the <em>Constitution Act</em>. The policy approach was subject to consideration  by NRCan and all partner departments, and seeking a consensus was difficult as  departments have differing views on the issue. Development of the approach  required extensive collaboration at all levels (from working level to DM)  across implicated departments and leveraged existing governance structures. </p>
<p>NRCan-SPC led the development  of the final position paper. The approach took almost a year to finalize,  involving multiple rounds of feedback on a variety of sensitive issues.  Following endorsement from NRCan’s DM, NRCan-P4PO communicated the decision to  the implicated community and led the development of common messaging for  departments to all Indigenous groups.</p>
<p>Federal key informants from  OGDs indicated this particular cross-cutting issue created lasting negative  impact on interdepartmental relationships. However, most federal key informants  agreed that it was not necessarily representative of the degree of discord or  level of effort required to reach a final position experienced in  implementation.</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Consistent  Messaging.</strong> As shown in Box 3,  there is evidence that NRCan has worked with OGDs to develop consistent  messaging in policy areas where departments have divergent views. Many federal  respondents indicated that there would not be a consistent position on  cross-cutting issues without NRCan playing a coordination and oversight role. Document  review and interviews also revealed that NRCan-SPC worked with NRCan-P4PO to  provide common speaking points on program availability and awareness for  Indigenous engagement. While federal interviewees perceived NRCan to be  effective in influencing consistent messaging, 50% of survey respondents  perceived this activity to be ineffective. Interviewees from all departments  recounted areas for improvement:
  <ul>
<li>There is a perceived lack of clear delineation  between the activities related to “communication” versus “engagement”, and who  is responsible for each. Communications need to be part of engagement, with  related coordination relying on the presence (or absence) of a robust  engagement plan. </li>
<li>Key external communication products (e.g., <a href="https://www.tmx-indigenous-portal.ca/home">TMX Indigenous Portal</a>,  updates to <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/campaign/trans-mountain.html">TMX website</a>)  were significantly delayed; these products were viewed as the least effective  in supporting expected results. A similar finding applies to communication  products delivered by NRCan-P4PO. Federal respondents underscored the many  factors that impeded timely delivery of public communication products,  including a lack of dedicated budget or expertise for communications within  NRCan-TMX and the requirement for horizontal input and approvals from OGDs. Evidence  suggests that some missteps in communications from NRCan have created discord  and misunderstanding. These were reported to have resulted in additional work  for OGDs and have increased the extent of scrutiny from partner departments.  While NRCan-TMX representatives reported using related lessons learned for  continuous improvement, this has still impeded timeliness of public  communications. </li>
<li>Some federal key informants also perceived gaps  in information sharing between NRCan’s TMX-Indigenous Advisory and Monitoring  Committee (IAMC)<sup id="fn7-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn7"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>7</a></sup> and  TMX coordination structures.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Regulatory  Coordination.</strong> The role of NRCan-SPC’s  regulatory permitting and authorization function is outlined in Box 4.  While NRCan did not set any performance  target specific to this area, the evaluation found that its role and function  were clear and that it was generally perceived as being effective. Respondents  from TMC noted that they were not entirely satisfied with the speed of  regulatory approvals but acknowledged that NRCan helped facilitate and expedite  this process (along with key decision makers in DFO and ECCC). While partner  departments effort to deliver permits and authorizations within legislated  timelines and aligned to the TMC’s construction schedule, proponents and  regulators have a responsibility to first ensure that all requirements are met  with respect to regulatory decisions. There is evidence of frequent meetings  with the external stakeholders and partner departments to help understand  operational issues, construction progress, and TMC’s priorities. Both TMC and  federal key informants perceived that NRCan-SPC was effective in helping to  steer the process and solving issues by convening partner departments and  external stakeholders (including provincial regulators) and by building  awareness of timelines among key parties.  </li>
</ul>
<h3> Box 4:  NRCan-SPC’s Regulatory Permitting and Authorization Function</h3>
<div class="well bg-success">
<p>NRCan-SPC    was tasked to manage, report on and address barriers to the Project’s    construction and operation. This included a role to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Monitor and    coordinate the permitting and regulatory authorizations required for the Project,    including federal and provincial permits, and the CER regulatory processes.</li>
<li>Support coordination    across federal departments to resolve issues related to federal permits.</li>
<li>Advance    relationships with the provinces of British Columbia and Alberta in relation    to TMX and monitor the progress of provincial permits.</li>
<li>Track progress    of regulatory authorizations, permitting activities and condition compliance.</li>
</ul>
<p>While    NRCan’s role was to facilitate the regulatory and permitting process, final    approval remains the responsibility of the regulator (responsible federal and    provincial government departments and agencies). </p>
</div>
<h3><strong>While horizontal  coordination has enabled efficiencies in some areas, improvements are still  required for existing mechanisms to ease the information flow.</strong></h3>
<p>Funding approvals for TMX Phase IV implementation indicate a  key expectation for NRCan-SPC to seek efficiencies in the delivery of  Project-related initiatives. Results indicate that half of the surveyed engagement  leads, and departmental coordinators considered NRCan-SPC to be ineffective in  finding efficiencies in the delivery of post-decision activities; only 20% considered  it to be effective. Engagement leads were again somewhat more negative than  departmental coordinators. The response did not vary significantly by  department. These perspectives are likely an extension of the previously noted  issues with government capacity available to address workload pressures.</p>
<p>Federal interviewees were somewhat more positive, noting  that horizontal coordination helps to identify areas to collaborate, facilitate  work, and break down silos across departments. However, federal key informants  from few departments underscored some areas for improvement. While internal communications  from NRCan-SPC have been solid, it is unclear if there are good channels for  feedback from OGDs to NRCan. There are conflicting views about the  effectiveness of DG+CC working groups and committees to funnel products to key  decision-makers (i.e., from Directors to DGs for approval). Some noted that it  takes a lot of time and resources to prepare for related meetings, but that  discussions are still slow (e.g., significant time spent debating about approach  to renewal). Key informants also indicated that in some cases there may be a  disconnect in the lines of communication between the working and senior levels  (decisions are not briefed up or briefed down) and between HQ &amp; regions.  There is a perceived need for a better mechanism to keep the process moving.  Currently, everything  needs to be negotiated, which can slow decision making if there is insufficient  DG oversight or attention.</p>
<h2 id="9"> What We Found: Effectiveness of the Phase IV Partnership Office</h2>
<div class="well bg-success">
<h3><strong>Summary of Key Findings: </strong><strong></strong>
</h3>
<h4><strong>Effectiveness of Coordination</strong></h4>
<p>Federal key informants generally perceived NRCan-P4PO to    be an innovative approach to engagement on major projects. However, there may    be a gap between Ministerial expectations on this point, i.e., need to move    quickly and work differently, and actual practice at the working level. Regardless,    federal respondents largely agreed that NRCan-P4PO has been effective in its    coordination role. It provides a useful and valuable role helping partner    departments navigate complexity, addresses more sensitive issues impacting a    small number of Indigenous groups, and provides a coordinated voice    representing the GOC where whole-of-government issues are concerned. </p>
<p>NRCan-P4PO has put in place various trackers and tools as    required to support the whole-of-government coordination. While these tools    are effective, the evaluation found limitations in some tracking systems to    support effective performance measurement. These systems were not robust    enough to provide accurate assessment of the depth of this engagement.</p>
<h4><strong>Effectiveness of Engagement </strong></h4>
<p>The engagement strategy developed by NRCan-P4PO was    finalized relatively late in Phase IV implementation. While NRCan-P4PO began    actively reaching out to groups well before the engagement strategy was finalized,    key communications products (e.g., P4PO newsletter and TMX Indigenous Portal)    were either delayed or underused.</p>
<p>Evidence suggests that NRCan-P4PO    regularly engages with many Indigenous groups and has met its performance    targets for initial outreach and engagement. However, while reasonable    measures of service delivery, these metrics do not provide information on the    meaningfulness of engagement. While they represent a limited sample of    Indigenous groups, Indigenous respondents generally rated the effectiveness    of P4PO’s engagement as “poor” to “fair” and provided diverse perspectives on    the meaningfulness of its engagement. The evaluation found evidence of a few    successful attempts to triage, streamline and tailor the Crown’s engagement    to reflect Indigenous groups’ concerns, interests, and project-related    impacts. However, the majority of federal and Indigenous respondents    disagreed that the federal approach to engagement on TMX has been effective    in reducing engagement fatigue. When compared to other GOC initiatives, NRCan-P4PO    did not stand out as a model of coordination on engagement. Even if    successfully implemented for TMX, NRCan-P4PO’s ability to reduce engagement    fatigue would still be limited in that it would not coordinate across other    (non-TMX) federal initiatives.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation    3:</strong> NRCan’s ADM Nòkwewashk should revise its approach to Indigenous engagement in ways    that build trust and cultivate meaningful relationships with Indigenous groups    (e.g., frequent check-in calls from engagement officers). This engagement    should be more proactive and include measures to mitigate the negative impact    of staff turnover on maintaining relationships.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation    4: </strong>NRCan’s ADM Nòkwewashk    should<strong> </strong>develop performance metrics for TMX Phase IV implementation    that are more meaningful to Indigenous groups.</p>
</div>
<p>The evaluation examined the extent to which NRCan-P4PO and  the mechanisms it has put in place were effective in facilitating a coordinated  and efficient implementation and delivery of post-decision activities related  to Indigenous engagement. The evaluation also examined the extent to which the  Phase IV Partnership Office has facilitated Indigenous people’s participation  in post-project decision activities. </p>
<h3><strong>Overall, federal  respondents agreed that NRCan-P4PO has been effective in coordination (though  not as a single window). </strong></h3>
<p>Funding approvals for TMX Phase IV implementation outlined  five key outcomes for NRCan-P4PO: </p>
<ul>
<li>maintain  and strengthen effective relationships with eligible Indigenous groups (through  a single window), by triaging and streamlining the Crown’s outreach efforts to  prevent capacity fatigue within Indigenous groups; </li>
<li>coordinate  the whole-of-government engagement plan with groups on accommodation measures,  permits and authorizations; </li>
<li>implement  a consultation process that supports distinction-based approach by tailoring  the consultation based on each Indigenous groups’ concerns, interests, and  project-related impacts; </li>
<li>engage  in an ongoing dialogue with Indigenous groups related to implementation of  accommodations measures, responses to NEB recommendations, and ongoing  regulatory and permitting processes; and  </li>
<li>track  and follow up on any commitments made during Phase III and Phase IV.  </li>
</ul>
<p>Effective implementation of these outcomes was paramount to  ensure that the GOC upheld its commitments to be responsive to Indigenous groups  with regards to concerns relating to the Project’s implementation. The delivery  of these commitments also provided support toward the GOC reconciliation with  Indigenous peoples. Federal key informants generally perceived NRCan-P4PO to be  an innovative approach to engagement on major projects. Usually, the GOC does  not continue to engage across the entire project life cycle (engagement ends  post-decision once consultations are complete). At least conceptually, NRCan-P4PO  helps ensure ongoing GOC accountability and discussion with Indigenous groups.  A few departments indicated that a project like TMX needs innovation and  creative thinking. However, they also perceived a (large) gap between  Ministerial expectations on this point, i.e., the need to move quickly and work  differently, and actual practice at the working level. </p>
<p>Regardless,  federal respondents largely agreed that NRCan-P4PO has been effective in its coordination  role. Half of survey respondents  (50%) indicated that NRCan-P4PO was effective in coordinating the GOC in  responding to Indigenous groups’ outstanding project-related concerns and  priorities; only 14% perceived NRCan-P4PO to be somewhat ineffective. Among  federal interviewees, NRCan was perceived to have effectively played  a sort of concierge role, i.e., to help partner departments navigate complexity  and address more sensitive issues impacting a small number of Indigenous groups.  OGDs will message the TMX inbox with known or emerging issues, and NRCan-P4PO  will assist by opening the door for difficult discussions. There was some  indication that this service is appreciated, particularly among those who  reported less internal expertise for Indigenous engagement. However, NRCan  staff and OGDs agreed that, as departments remain responsible for their own  programs, they also needed to be able to resolve their own issues. Regardless,  while not without its challenges (see Box 3), interviewees indicated that NRCan-P4PO  provides a very useful and valuable role as one voice representing the GOC  where whole-of-government issues are concerned, advancing a neutral perspective  to help federal departments agree on a path forward. </p>
<p>P4PO effectively supports coordination of messages within one-on-one  engagements by providing information on other programs and common speaking  points. NRCan-P4PO also shares information gleaned from its own engagement and that  of other departments to provide updates on emerging issues and the current  status of Indigenous groups (e.g., COVID-19 or wildfire closures, key contacts,  etc.). However, to do so effectively assumes that NRCan-P4PO is aware of what  was discussed (i.e., are included in one-on-one engagements and/or are briefed  on key issues by the lead department) and they know where and when OGDs are  going to engage. This is not always the case. </p>
<h3><strong>NRCan-P4PO is  tracking progress on engagement with Indigenous groups on an ongoing basis,  though with some limitations.</strong></h3>
<p>Document review revealed that NRCan-P4PO  has put in place various trackers and tools as required to support the  whole-of-government coordination (Appendix 3). These tracking tools serve two  broad functions: (1) tools aimed at documenting/tracking progress made about  the engagement with Indigenous groups, including to support performance  measurement; and (2) tools supporting the coordination of Indigenous engagement  among federal government departments that lead accommodation measures.</p>
<p>The majority of  surveyed respondents reported that the specific tools and processes developed  by NRCan-P4PO to coordinate engagement are effective (Figure 9). Senior federal  officials also noted the effectiveness of these tools. For example, broader  coordination of federal players through NRCan-P4PO’s engagement working group  helped identify linkages between the TMX and Roberts Bank Terminal 2 project.  While its use has waned somewhat over the past few months as OGDs lead more  direct engagements, an interdepartmental engagement calendar developed by  NRCan-P4PO has also been a key tool that has helped NRCan-P4PO coordinate  meetings and be more efficient. Engagement leads indicated that they are kept  aware of activities led by other departments and that NRCan-P4PO was effective  at reducing or avoiding competing meetings with Indigenous groups. </p>

<p>However, federal interviewees expressed mixed views about  the NRCan-P4PO tracking systems. Those with positive views noted that NRCan-P4PO  knows which Indigenous groups should have access to each accommodation measure  and appropriately tracks the extent to which they have engaged. Other  interviewees expressed doubts vis-à-vis the adequacy of the performance  measurement framework that NRCan-P4PO has put in place (see Table 3), noting  that metrics based on its ability to reach out and inform or remind Indigenous groups  of the supports available are reasonable measures of service delivery but do  not provide information on the effectiveness of that outreach or the  meaningfulness of engagement. </p>
<p>The evaluation process also found limitations in some of the  P4PO’s engagement and coordination tracking systems to support effective  performance measurement. These included outdated or (in a few cases) rescinded  information, replication of information among some of the trackers, and  misalignment with OGDs. Moreover, the outreach activities (e.g., number of  e-mails sent out to groups, the number of groups that reached out the GOC, or the  number of meetings held with a specific community) were not captured in a  consistent manner and information was disseminated in various repositories,  making it impossible for the evaluation team to have a comprehensive picture of  the depth of the NRCan-P4PO engagement activities throughout the time covered  by the scope of the evaluation. Some of these issues stem from staff turnover,  including challenges in knowledge transfer on how to effectively use the tools,  and cross-departmental IT limitations. Given these limitations, observations  made in the sections that follow about the attainment by NRCan-P4PO of its  engagement targets are mostly based on evidence provided through various  program performance reports (i.e., the evaluation was not able to replicate  this data). </p>
<h3><strong>NRCan-P4PO  developed an engagement strategy, but it was finalized relatively late in Phase  IV implementation. </strong></h3>
<p>NRCan-P4PO developed an engagement strategy to guide federal  departments through the engagement process, and to ensure that engagement was  timely, coordinated, and meaningful for Indigenous groups. While this document  provides valuable advice, it was first implemented in October 2020 (revised in  2021), many months into the engagement process. Some departments indicated that  the engagement strategy should have been in place at the outset. A few key  informants also questioned whether this guide was sufficiently robust. For  example, they noted that work on partnerships with Indigenous groups is complex  and perceived that NRCan-P4PO could have done more to understand and work  within the existing framework of partner departments.</p>
<p>While many interviewees noted a need for proactive  communication, a few perceived that P4PO’s approach has resulted in “just in  time” delivery of engagement communications and a struggle to identify the most  relevant information to communicate. NRCan-P4PO began  actively reaching out to groups with information on Phase IV well before the  engagement strategy was finalized. However, key communications products were either  delayed or underused. Perspectives related to specific tools or processes  shared by one or more respondents were to the effect that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>P4PO newsletter</strong>, intended as a simple  tool for information sharing within Indigenous groups, was planned as  a quarterly update but had only been published twice by Fall 2021. </li>
<li>The <a href="https://www.tmx-indigenous-portal.ca/home"><strong>TMX Indigenous Portal</strong></a> was developed to be a single window for key resources – e.g., application  guides, information sheets, speaking points for Indigenous groups, etc. The  concept of an Indigenous portal was not included in initial program design but  received approval from NRCan’s DM and NRCan Communications in January 2021.  However, the portal only went live in August 2021. This launch came too late into implementation to fully benefit its  target audience.</li>
<li>NRCan-P4PO sent <strong>letters</strong> in January 2021  to Indigenous groups who should have access to accommodations measures but who  had not yet engaged via workshops and outreach. Identification of these groups  was made possible by P4PO’s engagement tracking. Letters sent were then  supplemented by direct follow-up by individuals in line departments (as  appropriate, based on community eligibility). This process was perceived to be  effective: following the letter, there was some uptick in the number of  Indigenous groups accessing accommodations.</li>
</ul>
<p>The release of these products was slowed by approval from partner  departments on language. Moving forward without engaging OGDs would have been  difficult – without their input, products may not have included the right  information or may have been missing content. </p>
<p>During Phase III consultations, Indigenous peoples indicated  a need to have the GOC speaking from a single voice to prevent capacity fatigue  within Indigenous groups. Fulfilling this commitment was considered key for the  GOC to maintain and strengthen effective relationships with eligible Indigenous  groups. While all key informants agree that NRCan-P4PO has not fully fulfilled  its intended role as a “single window”, the evaluation  found evidence of a few successful attempts to triage and streamline the  Crown’s engagement. This includes instances of the following:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>General  information</strong> <strong>or one-off communication</strong> that benefited the vast  majority (or totality) of the 129 Indigenous groups. NRCan-P4PO helped  streamline engagement with Indigenous partners, by coordinating, with the  support of OGDs, broad communication (e.g., outreach letter, fall 2019  workshops, Indigenous Portal). In some cases, NRCan-P4PO staff also managed  one-off communication with Indigenous groups on behalf of all implicated  departments (e.g., COVID-19 engagement letter).</li>
<li><strong>Interdepartmental  coordination</strong> where NRCan-P4PO staff led interdepartmental meetings, along  with specific Indigenous groups, to facilitate access by the latter to accommodation  measures. Through these meetings, NRCan-P4PO sought the coordination of federal  departments’ actions, which was particularly important when groups needed to  access multiple accommodation measures at the same time. </li>
<li><strong>Cross-cutting  issues</strong> brought to the table by NRCan-P4PO where there was a need for  collective awareness and/or action. Many of these cross-cutting issues touched  upon eligibility to accommodation measures and required that NRCan-P4PO staff  coordinate multiple departments’ involvement. NRCan-P4PO coordinated  communication concerning the federal departments’ response in these sensitive  cases. </li>
<li><strong>Targeted  communication</strong> shared from NRCan-P4PO to a subset of Indigenous groups on  behalf of NRCan and partner departments (e.g., letters sent to the groups that  had yet to engage).</li>
</ol>
<p>Despite these efforts, the majority  of federal respondents disagreed that the federal approach to engagement on TMX  has been effective in reducing engagement fatigue within Indigenous groups.  Some noted that, at the outset, NRCan-P4PO’s coordinated engagement was useful  to inform Indigenous groups on accommodation measures. This was perceived as  more efficient (for both the GOC and the Indigenous  groups) than one-off meetings. However, departments continue to engage  bilaterally with Indigenous groups.  While no federal respondents perceived this bilateral engagement as  inappropriate, a few departments’ representatives identified the following  disadvantages to the more disaggregated approach:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sometimes it comes in opposition with the  whole-of-government approach, i.e., lack of coordination may cause Indigenous groups  to need to choose which department(s) to prioritize for engagement, at the  expense of accommodation measures led by other departments.</li>
<li>Line departments do not always inform the  federal family before they engage in discussions. This makes it challenging to  coordinate and weakens the federal government’s ability to reduce burden or  engagement fatigue for Indigenous groups.</li>
<li>NRCan-P4PO is not always present at meetings led  by OGDs, which limits its ability to support horizontal messaging.</li>
<li>There has been confusing and inconsistent messaging about  eligibility for accommodation measures for certain Indigenous groups. This has  presented some challenges interdepartmentally as well as for NRCan-P4PO external  communication with Indigenous groups.</li>
</ul>
<p>At the same time, even if  successfully implemented for TMX, many departments indicated NRCan-P4PO’s  ability to reduce engagement fatigue would still be limited in that it would  not coordinate across other (non-TMX) federal initiatives.</p>
<h3><strong>Evidence  suggests that NRCan-P4PO regularly engages with a large number of Indigenous groups  and has met its performance targets for engagement. </strong></h3>
<p>Maintaining an ongoing dialogue with Indigenous groups was  important for the GOC to ensure an effective, coordinated implementation of TMX  Phase IV. NRCan set up a performance framework intended to demonstrate that the  GOC is continuously engaging with Indigenous peoples. The evaluation team  examined program documents and performance reports to assess the extent to  which these targets were met. A summary of results is shown in Table 3. </p>
<p>In September 2019, NRCan-P4PO sent an opening outreach  e-mail to the 129 Indigenous groups deemed eligible to participate in  post-decision activities. The letter introduced the NRCan Phase IV Partnership  Office’s role to support Indigenous  groups and that of the federal departments leading accommodation  measures. NRCan respondents perceive that they made “best efforts” to engage  coming out of Phase III. They wanted to make sure that Indigenous groups were well informed. However, a few  departments’ respondents agreed that this initial outreach could have been  better coordinated with a portal where all the information was in one place.</p>

<p>NRCan also targeted NRCan-P4PO to provide the totality of  the eligible Indigenous groups with multiple opportunities to engage in  post-decision activities between 2019 and March 2022. For the purpose of its  performance target, NRCan-P4PO defined “engagement” to include any form of one-way  or two-way communication with Indigenous groups. Using this broad definition, the  examination of program documents suggests that a substantial number of  Indigenous groups were given multiple opportunities to engage, following the  initial outreach by NRCan-P4PO (see Figure 10). As of September 2021, documents  indicate that NRCan-P4PO is engaging on an ongoing basis with up to 122 of the  129 Indigenous groups (95%). There is clear evidence of at least 7 Indigenous groups  not being regularly engaged for various reasons (e.g., at the request of the  community). </p>

<p>The fourth circle shows March 2021: COVID-19 engagement letter to 129 groups.</p>
</details></p>
<p>Source: Program Documents</p>
<p>This engagement involved one-way communication from  NRCan-P4PO to Indigenous groups (e.g., letters and invitations) and two-way  communication (e.g., meetings and workshops) that allowed groups to participate  and provide input into the implementation of the accommodation measures. Dozens  of bilateral meetings with staff from NRCan-P4PO and other federal partner  departments also provided opportunities for Indigenous groups to express their  views, needs or concerns about proposed accommodations measures. However, the  evaluation process could not firmly conclude on the depth of Indigenous groups’  engagement, nor determine the extent NRCan-P4PO has incorporated Indigenous  peoples’ concerns or needs following interactions with federal departments.</p>
<p>NRCan-P4PO staff is also tracking progress against the  one-off (bespoke) commitments made by the Crown during Phase III consultations.  Program tracking tools suggested that eight of the 22 commitments (36%) were in  progress as of August 2021, while 14 out of 22 (64%) were completed in the same  period. Some Indigenous groups were reported to be very proactive and invested  in the process to see these completed. NRCan-P4PO is now in the process of  reviewing and tracking progress and developing a work plan as to how to reach  completeness. However, in some cases, commitments were vague or may be  considered ongoing; it will be more challenging to know when these are  “complete”.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding these efforts, survey results suggest that only  about 41.7% of working level engagement or initiative leads and departmental  coordinators indicated that NRCan-P4PO was somewhat effective (16.7%) or very  effective (25%) in supporting Indigenous groups in ongoing engagement regarding  TMX accommodation measures.<sup id="fn8-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn8"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>8</a></sup> About 20% of engagement or initiative leads reported that NRCan-P4PO was  somewhat ineffective. In general, respondents indicated that one-off communications  (e.g., initial reach out to groups) have been effective whereas products  intended as either ongoing or periodic updates (e.g., TMX Indigenous portal)  were ineffective in facilitating the engagement of Indigenous groups.  Open-ended responses indicate a perception that NRCan-P4PO is “bogged down” by  process (e.g., approval delays) and suggested improvements are required in the  timeliness and consistency of communications from NRCan to Indigenous groups.</p>
<h3><strong>Indigenous groups appear to be unclear  on the role of NRCan-P4PO and divided about the extent to which they have been  engaged.</strong></h3>
<p>The evaluation team gathered Indigenous groups’ perspectives  to assess the extent to which they have been effectively engaged by NRCan-P4PO (see  Box 5). Logically, to speak to the effectiveness of P4PO, Indigenous groups  must first be aware of its existence and be at least somewhat familiar with its  mandate. To this end, the evaluation sought to gauge Indigenous respondents’  level of knowledge concerning NRCan-P4PO and its mandate.</p>
<h4>Box 5: A Framework for Evaluating Indigenous Engagement</h4>
<div class="well bg-success">
<p>Effectiveness    of Indigenous engagement is related to (1) fairness of the engagement (e.g.,    transparency, representativeness, equity) and (2) efficiency of the engagement    exercise in achieving its intended purpose (be it based on communication,    consultation, or participation of Indigenous peoples, or some combination of    these activities). To achieve its intended purpose requires NRCan-P4PO to    have selected the appropriate types of engagement mechanisms. The information    transferred to / elicited from Indigenous groups also needs to be the right    information (e.g., clear, relevant, accurate, represents the views of    Indigenous groups, etc.).</p>
</div>
<p>Source: Kelly Sears Consulting</p>
<p>The evaluation’s random sample included at least 16 out of  49 Indigenous groups for which the contact information for key representatives  provided by NRCan-P4PO was outdated. Maintaining contact information can be a  challenge given turnover of key staff within Indigenous groups, but a lack of  up-to-date contact information suggests deficiencies in the effectiveness of  P4PO’s outreach.</p>
<p>Of those who did participate in the evaluation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Despite its lead role in initial outreach to  Indigenous groups on Phase IV, no Indigenous respondent provided a resounding  response that they had learned about TMX accommodation measures from P4PO. Some  indicated that they may have heard about opportunities to participate from  other NRCan sources (e.g., IPO-W), from the TMX-IAMC, or other external sources  (e.g., directly from TMC or via other GOC initiatives). </li>
<li>Respondents for many groups (50% or above)  reported some level of awareness of P4PO’s engagement tools (e.g., meetings,  emails, Indigenous Portal). However, only a few (less than 50%) were confident  that this engagement was indeed from NRCan-P4PO (vs. a partner department). A  few also stated that while they knew that NRCan-P4PO had engaged with their group  or community, they had not heard from NRCan-P4PO for an extended period.</li>
</ul>
<p>While a limited  sample, input from these respondents also confirmed the evaluation’s  finding that NRCan-P4PO has not delivered on its mandate to become the single  window on TMX for Indigenous groups. Overall, regardless of their ability to recall engagement with P4PO,  the majority expressed confusion regarding who was involved in the TMX Phase IV  (i.e., departments, agencies, and individuals). Many indicated they did not  know where to look or who to contact if they had a question or concern about  the TMX accommodations measures and were unaware that NRCan-P4PO could help  facilitate these connections. None of these respondents reported having  reached out to NRCan-P4PO to facilitate the making contact with a federal  department leading a particular accommodation measure. Instead, the Indigenous  informants stated that, if necessary, they would simply contact the lead  department directly. Partner departments perceived direct “grassroots”  engagement on specific accommodation measures to be building positive  relationships between OGDs and Indigenous groups.</p>
<h3><strong>Overall, Indigenous groups rated the  effectiveness of P4PO’s engagement as “poor” to “fair”.</strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong></h3>
<p>Overall, the  evaluation found that respondents from Indigenous groups that were not familiar  with the P4PO’s mandate provided negative feedback on its effectiveness simply  because they were not aware of NRCan-P4PO. Otherwise, several respondents explained  that they gave low ratings as they perceived this team to provide too much,  generic information – i.e., insufficiently tailored for their respective  community’s needs. While communications mechanisms, particularly e-mails and letters,  were perceived as effective, the frequency of these communications and amount  of information were perceived to be overwhelming. These respondents indicated  they are participating in multiple federal and provincial programming  initiatives and are challenged to cope with the enormous volume of email  traffic, and as a result often lacked the capacity (e.g., time and resources)  to review non-targeted communications. Similarly, while workshops were  perceived as effective, the ability to build relationships because of these  events was negatively affected by frequent federal staff turnover and the large  number of attendees. The TMX Indigenous Portal was perceived to be a useful communication  mechanism but introduced too late. </p>
<p>For the GOC, applying a distinction-based approach to  Indigenous consultations on TMX was important to ensure the full participation  and ongoing involvement of Indigenous peoples in post-decision activities. To  this end, funding approvals indicated that <a name="_Hlk106888060">NRCan-P4PO would  tailor its process based on each Indigenous group’s concerns, interests, and  project-related impacts </a>(as identified in Phase III Consultations). The  evaluation team examined the tools, activities and processes the Phase IV  Partnership Office has put in place to affect this direction. </p>
<p>The NRCan-TMX Engagement Strategy (2020, 2021) introduced  six types of groups based on considerations affecting access and participation  in TMX initiatives and provides guidance on how to engage on accommodation  measures for each of the six groups. The evaluation found evidence of some of these activities  in practice. The engagement activities that NRCan-P4PO developed in  collaboration with partner departments and (to lesser extent) with Indigenous  groups were shaped to respond to groups’ specific impacts, with the 129  Indigenous groups divided into in three broad groups: Terrestrial, Marine, and  combined Marine / Terrestrial. When required, NRCan-P4PO convened and led multidepartment  meetings to ensure that specific groups dealing with different accommodation  measures could easily access different federal organization through the same  venue. By contrast, there is also evidence that NRCan-P4PO engaged in  bilateral meetings when preferred by Indigenous groups. The NRCan-P4PO co-led  several workshops with terrestrial groups while setting up bilateral meetings  with marine groups who have expressed the desire to engage through meetings  rather than workshops.</p>
<p>Despite these efforts, 50% of federal survey participants who reported knowledge of engagement  on TMX neither agreed nor disagreed that the P4PO’s engagement approach has  been sufficiently tailored to the needs and capacity of each Indigenous  community. Only 30% somewhat agreed that it had been sufficiently  tailored. Respondents from NRCan-P4PO indicated that a tailored approach was  not required in all cases. This statement was somewhat echoed by some key  informants from partner departments who indicated that smaller Indigenous groups  may be more overwhelmed by federal initiatives and be harder to reach or  require more support. While this suggests that an issue that needs to be addressed, <a name="_Hlk106888186">it is not clear that respondents would consider this to be  the responsibility of NRCan-P4PO. </a>Those partner departments that directly  engaged with Indigenous groups stated that they are already tailoring their  approach to engagement to the best of their ability. See the next section of  this report for more information on Indigenous capacity and capacity funding.</p>
<h3><strong>Indigenous groups provided diverse  perspectives on the meaningfulness of P4PO’s engagement.</strong></h3>
<p>The majority of  surveyed engagement leads and departmental coordinators disagree that there has  been sufficient time for meaningful dialogue with Indigenous groups, with a few  reporting that they had heard concerns from Indigenous groups about the  frequency and depth of engagement or groups’ capacity to engage.</p>
<p>Respondents from  Indigenous groups that were aware of NRCan-P4PO’s mandate expressed diverse  opinions on the meaningfulness of engagement. Most Indigenous respondents  reported that relationships emerging from Phase III were not strengthened  and/or maintained, indicating a need for the relationship to move from one of  one-way communication to full (two-way) participation. A few indicated that NRCan-P4PO  enabled meaningful engagement, perceiving NRCan-P4PO to have made an honest  attempt to provide many opportunities to participate. These respondents  perceived that NRCan-P4PO did a “good” to “very good” job of informing groups  about TMX accommodations measures, with one indicating that any inquiries were  expediently and professionally dealt with by P4PO. Others reported that NRCan-P4PO did not provide  sufficient opportunities to their groups to participate in the discussions  about TMX accommodation measures.  Even those who gave good ratings did so with a caveat that the experience was  still generally perceived to be overwhelming.</p>
<h3><strong>When compared to other GOC initiatives,  NRCan-P4PO did not stand out as a model of coordination. </strong><strong> </strong></h3>
<p>A review of the relevance and effectiveness of specific  accommodation measures was outside the scope of this evaluation. However, the evaluation did examine the extent to  which coordination affected by NRCan-P4PO achieved the intended result of  increasing the ease of working with the GOC across TMX accommodation measures.  As such, informants were asked to provide their perspective about the clarity  and accessibility of the application process related to the TMX accommodation  measures. </p>
<p>Evaluation findings suggest that there is still room for  improvement. Overall, most Indigenous respondents (75% and above) perceived the  TMX application process to be clear and accessible, but with some caveats that the process often required assistance  from experts engaged by their groups. Respondents from a few groups perceived  that TMX Phase IV was less well-coordinated compared to other GOC funding  programs because there were too many players involved in the Project. A few groups  saw no difference, stating that it was just as well (or not well) coordinated as  other GOC initiatives.</p>
<h2 id="10">What We Found: Facilitating and Impeding Factors</h2>
<div class="well bg-success">
<h3><strong>Summary of Key Findings:</strong>
</h3>
<p>We found several external and    internal factors that influenced or could influence the effective and    efficient delivery of the Project’s activities. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Contextual    Factors.</strong> TMX is a high profile, complex and time-sensitive Project for    which post-decision federal activities are unprecedented in scale or scope. While    the evaluation found issues in the effectiveness of processes and achievement    of results, federal respondents perceive that coordination on TMX has been reasonably    effective in consideration of this broader context and the multifaceted    challenges faced in implementation.</li>
<li><strong>Facilitating    Factors.</strong> Federal respondents generally agreed that the existence of a    coordination function itself was a factor critical to success. The quality of    support from the NRCan-TMX teams and ongoing support from senior management    have also facilitated effectiveness to the extent this was achieved. However,    Indigenous respondents perceived room to improve skillsets for engagement    (e.g., tailored communications) and reported challenges with building and    maintaining relationships exacerbated by frequent federal staff turnover.</li>
<li><strong>Impeding    Factors.</strong> Impeding factors with the greatest impact on the effectiveness    of NRCan-SPC were GOC capacity and the federal decision-making and    accountability regime for TMX. Specifically, that NRCan was given the mandate    and accountability for coordination but does not have the authority to direct    the actions of partner departments. By contrast, key factors impeding the    effectiveness of NRCan-P4PO relate more so to the federal government’s and    Indigenous groups’ capacity for (coordinated) engagement. NRCan-P4PO has    recognized and made attempts to respond to a need for additional capacity for    Indigenous groups, but there is room for further improvement.      </li>
</ul>
<p>There is evidence that NRCan-TMX has effectively    responded to some factors within the program’s sphere of influence that were    likely to impede effectiveness and efficiency. Nevertheless, TMX Phase IV    implementation was adversely affected by several unforeseen events that were    not considered in funding approvals.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 5:</strong> NRCan’s ADM Nòkwewashk should work with partner departments to    improve the definition and communication of roles and responsibilities for    coordination of TMX Phase IV implementation, including working    collaboratively to develop dispute resolution mechanisms.</p></div>
<p>The evaluation examined whether there were factors that  facilitated or impeded the effectiveness and efficiency of TMX Phase IV coordination.</p>
<h3><strong>Many contextual  factors have or could influence effective and efficient delivery of Phase IV coordination.</strong></h3>
<p>The evaluation identified numerous contextual factors impacting  the effectiveness of TMX Phase IV coordination (see Table 4). The ability to  respond, particularly to external factors, will depend on the program’s sphere  of influence with some factors inherent to the Project’s nature and scope  (e.g., number of Indigenous groups engaged). Other factors relate to the  program design and implementation, over which NRCan and partner departments  have more control or influence. </p>
<h4>Table 4:  Contextual Factors That Have Influenced TMX Phase IV Coordination</h4>
<table class="table table-bordered">
<tr>
<td><p><strong>TMX    Project Profile</strong></p></td>
<td><p>TMX is a high-profile project with high    political interest or sensitivity. The project also has important    implications for other GOC priorities, such as the climate change agenda.    Failure to implement the Crowns' commitments to Indigenous peoples related to    TMX could also negatively influence the advancement of reconciliation. This    creates high expectations for performance (i.e., to work quickly and    effectively), particularly within NRCan-TMX. Phase IV implementation of TMX is    unprecedented in scale and scope and related action must proceed with    awareness that it may set a precedent for other major projects.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p><strong>Horizontal    results implications</strong></p></td>
<td><p>While    not a horizontal program, there are multiple federal departments involved in    TMX Phase IV implementation including but not limited to partner departments.    There are horizontal policy and operational implications to this situation:    success on TMX requires that all departments succeed, not just one. </p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p><strong>Concurrent complexity, and    varying levels of capacity to manage this complexity</strong></p></td>
<td><p>It is hard to fully    anticipate needs and risks for any major project. Given that Indigenous groups    are not homogenous, it is typically challenging to design GOC programs with    results (targets) that are responsive to or reflect the priorities of all those    implicated. TMX is particularly complex, with a broad geography that engages    numerous Indigenous groups, multiple departments, and many other partners and    stakeholders (e.g., industry, provinces, coastal communities, etc.). Indigenous    groups also face many competing priorities, including overlap of TMX Phase IV    implementation with other federal programs (e.g., Oceans Protection Plan) and    major projects (e.g., Roberts Bank Terminal 2). The result is numerous    bilateral and multi-level conversations with Indigenous groups where the    federal government may compete with itself to get their attention, which taxes    capacity and adds to engagement fatigue.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p><strong>Ownership    of TMX</strong></p></td>
<td><p>Canada’s    current ownership of the pipeline also necessitates coordination with Finance    Canada who, through the Canada Development Investment Corporation, ensures    accountability for this public investment.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p><strong>Timeline and pace of    implementation</strong></p></td>
<td><p>Hundreds of millions of    dollars in programming were provided within the five-year funding window for    Phase IV implementation. However, while some initiatives are expected to be    renewed, existing funding approvals are time limited (sunset between March    2022 to March 2025, depending on the initiative). There is a shared sense of    urgency to deliver but not all departments or their initiatives are moving at    the same pace. There is also a need to coordinate engagements but not all partner    departments or Indigenous groups are ready to engage at the same time. </p>
<p>At the time of the    evaluation, the deadline for some of this funding was rapidly approaching    without clear direction or a funding decision on renewal. Some Indigenous    respondents indicated that this was impacting their confidence that the    Government will continue to do the work and, by extension, was also perceived    by some federal engagement leads surveyed to be limiting uptake of    accommodation measures.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p><strong>Unforeseen events and competing priorities</strong></p></td>
<td><p>There    were many unforeseen events that have negatively impacted project delivery,    including a major health crisis (COVID-19) and natural disasters (e.g.,    wildfire, flood). Other events, such as the residential school gravesite    findings, have also greatly affected Indigenous groups and the attention and    resources they have available to engage on accommodation measures. Federal    respondents disagreed on the extent to which delays in implementation could    be attributed to unforeseen events but agreed that these events have    amplified existing pressures and impacted Indigenous groups’ capacity to    respond to these competing priorities. </p></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Most federal interviewees agreed  that coordination on TMX has been effective in consideration of this broader  context. Respondents (particularly in partner departments) indicated that  NRCan-TMX may have lacked strong awareness of the full spectrum of GOC  priorities and initiatives at the outset of implementation; this was reported  to have improved with time and NRCan-TMX is now an important observer /  participant in related discussions. Additional departments (e.g., Impact  Assessment Agency of Canada [IAAC], Crown Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs  Canada [CIRNAC], etc.) now attend NRCan-SPC and NRCan-P4PO meetings to help  improve the flow of information and coordination of engagement. </p>
<h3>The TMX Phase IV coordination function  and NRCan team have facilitated the delivery on TMX Phase IV.</h3>
<p>The following factors were reported  to facilitate the effectiveness and efficiency of Phase IV coordination:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Coordination Function</strong>. Federal respondents  generally agreed that the existence of a coordination function itself was a  factor critical to success, e.g., allowing departments to effectively gauge  progress. Coordination also provides a forum for transparent decision-making,  where the rationale behind decisions can be openly discussed and issues can be  resolved (adding value regardless of whether OGDs agreed on the final  decision). These discussions are perceived to benefit from the inclusion of  other federal partners (e.g., IAAC, CIRNAC, central agencies). </li>
<li><strong>Quality of the NRCan Team</strong>. The quality,  commitment, and support offered by the NRCan team is a factor reported to  enable the effectiveness of TMX Phase IV. NRCan’s team was perceived to be highly functioning,  with clear points of contact, strong corporate knowledge, and dedication to the  work. Within NRCan and across partner departments, most respondents reported  having a positive working relationship with NRCan-SPC and NRCan-P4PO. </li>
<li><strong>Ongoing Senior Management Support, </strong>including  participation in interdepartmental governance structures, was perceived to be a  critical facilitating factor (albeit one some indicated was not always present).</li>
</ul>
<p>Engagement leads recognized the quality of the support they  received from NRCan-P4PO at the ground level. Despite this, most respondents  from Indigenous groups (75% or more) perceived that NRCan-P4PO lacked the  skillset required to engage effectively (with the caveat that less than 50% of respondents  were confident that their engagement was indeed from NRCan-P4PO and not a  partner department). Overall, they reported challenges with building and maintaining  a relationship exacerbated by frequent federal staff turnover. Interactions  with NRCan-P4PO were perceived to be sporadic and/or negatively impacted by a  lack of timely follow-up on feedback provided by the community. Some groups reported  that it was challenging to keep track of the federal staff and contacts,  including but not limited to NRCan-P4PO. As previously noted, groups also  perceived that communications were not sufficiently tailored or plain language.  Conversely, one respondent (representing three communities) was very positive  about the P4PO’s engagement skills; this respondent was a consultant with pre-existing  expertise in administering federal grants and contributions on behalf of  communities. </p>
<p>Respondents from a few groups (less than 50%) stated that  their pre-existing relationship with NRCan related to the TMX project somewhat  negatively affected their assessment of P4PO. These groups noted that there  were ongoing, unresolved issues with NRCan that needed to be addressed and that  their priorities were not being well reflected in the available accommodation  measures.</p>
<h3><strong>Several factors impede  the effectiveness of TMX Phase IV coordination, many with particular  implications for Indigenous engagement.</strong></h3>
<p>Table 5 provides a summary of the factors found to  impede the effectiveness and efficiency of Phase IV coordination, some of which  have been discussed previously. A few of these factors are internal,  with a negative impact on NRCan and partner departments. These include workload  pressures and the level of resources allocated for coordination. Many of these factors  also have a direct, negative impact on Indigenous groups already experiencing  engagement fatigue. </p>
<h4>Table 5: Factors Impeding the Effectiveness of the TMX Phase IV Coordination</h4>
<div class="well bg-success">
<p><strong>Federal Decision-Making and Accountability</strong>. NRCan was given the mandate and accountability for    coordination but does not have the authority to direct the actions of partner    departments. While there is evidence that NRCan works hard to ensure    decisions are transparent and reflect consensus, several respondents from partner departments also perceive NRCan to    have made some decisions without adequate regard for their input (or adequate    engagement at the working level) and/or a perceived lack of strategic    consideration for impacts on other programs or existing relationships with    Indigenous groups.<strong> </strong></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Deterioration of    Shared Vision. </strong>All departments    continue to share a common goal to see the TMX Project built responsibly.    However, many senior federal interviewees indicated that there has been a    deterioration of the initial shared vision for how this will be achieved, attributed    by most of these respondents to staff turnover coupled with decreased    momentum from senior leadership. <strong></strong></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Government    Capacity.</strong> TMX Phase IV    implementation requires a very high level of effort for coordination. OGD    respondents identified that that complex internal coordination within their    own organization (required to ensure internal accountability) creates a    multiplying effect to each tasking from NRCan. Some perceive themselves to have    an insufficient level of resources to support this coordination. Constant    demands to deliver on tight timelines put pressure on the limited capacity in    partner departments. High levels of staff turnover (including loss of    corporate knowledge and frequently needing to onboard new staff) contribute    to these pressures. While many would prefer some streamlining or reduction in    level of effort, most believe that the benefits derived from coordination    outweigh the costs of collaboration.<strong> </strong></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Lack of Flexibility    to Use More Innovative Tools and Processes</strong>. Several key informants (including at least one Indigenous    respondent) indicated a need to be more innovative on TMX. In their view, the    current federal regulations and policies being applied are outdated and do    not adequately consider the specific requirements of Indigenous peoples or the    role of accommodations measures in advancing reconciliation. For example,    both federal and Indigenous respondents indicated that it would be easier for    Indigenous groups if there was just one application (or at least a common    template) for all accommodation measures. This was reportedly discussed at    the outset by NRCan and partner departments but a joint process for G&amp;C    funding was deemed to be too administratively challenging.<strong></strong></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Communications    Limitations</strong>. The line between    “communication” and “engagement” is not clearly defined. Requirements for    multiple, horizontal input and approvals have delayed release and reduced the    effectiveness of key communication or engagement products. There was also no    budget set aside for communications; NRCan-P4PO are not communications    experts.<strong></strong></p>
</div>
<p>Among the factors identified in  Table 5, those with the greatest impact on the effectiveness of NRCan-SPC were  perceived to be GOC capacity and the federal decision-making and accountability  regime. There is general agreement that decision making in  coordination of Phase IV implementation has been slower than expected, with  delays created in part by extended timelines for review and approvals. Requests  for information from NRCan-SPC to partner departments are often communicated as  being urgent, but the time delay to effect decisions or actions in response to this  information does not always clearly demonstrate that such urgency was required.  This creates push back against the NRCan-TMX teams, which negatively affects  both performance and job satisfaction (which can further compound pressure by  leading to staff turnover). </p>
<p>By contrast, key factors impeding the effectiveness of  NRCan-P4PO relate more so to the federal government’s and Indigenous groups’  capacity for (coordinated) engagement. Findings from the evaluation’s  Indigenous engagement agree in this regard with early analyses of engagement  obstacles completed by P4PO. Respondents from most groups (50% or more) stated  that their capacity limited meaningful engagement and prevented them from  taking advantage of all the accommodation opportunities available, indicating  that there were important foundational capacity issues that needed to be  addressed including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Human capacity – difficulty in finding, training,  and retaining qualified employees to manage the large workload associated with  administration of accommodation measures, particularly given the time-limited  nature of funding.</li>
<li>Physical capacity – a need for basic  infrastructure that would enable effective participation such as office space  to house staff, equipment, good internet connections, etc. </li>
<li>Information capacity – difficulties faced by  Indigenous groups in gathering the information they need to inform their  decision-making, including about the Project itself (e.g., construction and  project updates from TMC) and challenges in accessing existing data within  their traditional territory.</li>
</ul>
<p>Capacity funding to support participation was included in  the design of some accommodation measures. Others, such as TC’s Enhanced Maritime Situational  Awareness (EMSA) Initiative, lacked funding for proposal development as  well as capacity funding for eligible groups to adopt and implement the EMSA  accommodation measure. This makes it difficult for groups to actively participate.  Federal interviewees also noted that capacity funding was unavailable to  support participation in the implementation of CER recommendations, which they  perceived to be a gap.</p>
<p>In addition to capacity  funding linked to specific accommodation measures, NRCan received $1.5M in  G&amp;Cs to support Indigenous groups’ participation in engagement and  consultation activities with the Crown. The availability of this “transition  funding” was not communicated to Indigenous groups on a proactive basis but was  rather to be used on an as-needed basis to bridge gaps identified by  NRCan-P4PO. As of March 2022, only about 30% of this funding had been spent.  NRCan-P4PO has recognized and made attempts to respond to a need for additional  capacity for Indigenous groups, but there is room for further improvement (see  Box 6).
</p>
<h4>Box 6: Effectiveness of NRCan-P4PO Capacity Support</h4>
<div class="well bg-success">
<p>In    2021, NRCan-P4PO used some of its G&amp;Cs to provide funding to a Senior    Engagement Officer from CANDO, a national Indigenous organization    involved in community economic development. This individual is now available    to work with Indigenous groups as a consultant to prepare funding proposals,    claims, and reports. Information about services available is advertised on    the TMX Indigenous Portal.</p>
<p>As    of March 2022, CANDO had successfully assisted 15 Indigenous groups to    develop proposals for capacity funding that have led to contribution    agreements under two TMX accommodation measures (the Aquatic Habitat    Restoration Fund and Terrestrial Cumulative Effects Initiative). </p>
<p>However, NRCan could have    better executed this service. NRCan-P4PO indicated that possible improvements    included: (1) better communication of services available to Indigenous groups;    (2) better orientation for CANDO on details of accommodations measures; and    (3) better coordination on engagement at earliest phase of contract between    CANDO and departments responsible for accommodation measures.</p>
</div>
<p>While some Indigenous respondents reported having received  capacity funding to engage, others indicated they were still waiting to receive  approved funds from the responsible department(s) or had used their own  resources to participate. Regardless, most noted that the current approach to  providing for immediate capacity needs does not address foundational capacity  issues or allow for sustainability in Indigenous groups’ capacity to engage  with the GOC in the future (on TMX and beyond). One community stated that the  short-term capacity funding provided might inadvertently harm the groups as it  presents a substantial risk of “overextension” (i.e., inability to maintain  investments in staff, infrastructure, and equipment after the funding ends).  Some federal respondents also questioned whether capacity funding was  sufficient or the right type of support in all cases given the needs to be  addressed, e.g., there may be a more effective way for federal departments to  ensure that Indigenous groups have the scientific and technical capacity  required to access the accommodation measures. </p>
<h3><strong>There is evidence  that NRCan-TMX has effectively responded to some factors within the program’s  sphere of influence</strong><strong> that were likely to impede  effectiveness and efficiency.</strong></h3>
<p>The evaluation examined the extent to which the NRCan-TMX  coordination structures were effective in addressing identified impediments to  effectiveness and efficiency. The evaluation found several instances where  NRCan-TMX has identified and addressed these impediments. To some extent, this  is part of NRCan’s role in federal coordination. For example, NRCan-TMX was  perceived to be very responsive to the needs of senior management. The staff is  proactive in identifying emerging issues and providing information required to  respond. </p>
<p>Interviewees from all departments also pointed to examples  of where NRCan-TMX and/or partner departments recognized hindering factors and  took responsive action. Some of the course-correction actions that were underscored  during the interviews with federal government informants are as follow:</p>
<ul>
<li>There was a lack of clarity around one-off  commitments made during Phase III consultations. NRCan reviewed and confirmed  responsibility for bespoke commitments and communicated this to OGDs.</li>
<li>NRCan-TMX and OGDs have adjusted resource  allocations from the initially planned allocation to respond to the actual  workflow, including the number and level of staff. </li>
<li>Roles and responsibilities have been  periodically reviewed and adjusted to ensure that coordination activities  remain aligned. This does not mean that further improvements are not possible.  For example, some federal interviewees noted a separation between NRCan-P4PO’s marine and terrestrial engagement teams that  served well at the outset (as accommodation  measures were very different for each)  but can now maybe be streamlined.</li>
<li>The DG+CC was formed to help with the flow of  information between the working and senior levels. Having perceived an issue  with the effectiveness of these meetings, NRCan-TMX reported that it has  started having informal meetings with counterparts in OGDs to get a sense of  clients’ needs to provide better support. Program managers indicated that they  may need to adjust their assumptions on the value of activities and be clearer  on what activities are required and at what level of responsibility.</li>
</ul>
<p>The delivery of the TMX-Phase IV and the current evaluation  process were adversely affected by several unforeseen events (e.g., COVID-19  and natural disasters) that were not considered in funding approvals. There is  evidence that NRCan’s coordination structures tracked the events’ impacts on each  community to inform federal engagement (e.g., changes in key contacts) and adjust  their own approach to demonstrate sensitivity to pressures introduced. Data also suggest that NRCan coordination structures  and OGDs were able to effectively shift in a virtual work in response to COVID,  but this was not necessarily true of all Indigenous partners. Particularly with  the increased likelihood of climate events impacting natural resources  projects, there is a need to further include contingency plans in GOC program  designs. Reprofiling exercises and assessments of departmental responses that  occurred in response to COVID-19 could provide valuable baseline information to  consider when developing contingency plans for such unforeseen events.</p>
<h2 id="11">What We Found: Ongoing Need </h2>
<div class="well bg-success">
<h3><strong>Summary of Key Findings:</strong>
</h3>
<p>NRCan and partner departments    generally agree on the continued need for TMX Phase IV coordination for at    least as long as the accommodation measures are still being implemented    and/or construction is ongoing and advocated a need to preserve the corporate    knowledge built during the implementation of TMX Phase IV.  While NRCan may currently be best placed to    lead on coordination across departments, where the coordination function is    located is not perceived to be important provided that it continues to ensure    the Crown’s commitments made during Phase III consultations and Phase IV are    being met. </p>
<p>There is stronger support    expressed towards maintaining NRCan-SPC than NRCan-P4PO. For senior managers,    the key question relates not to continued need for NRCan-SPC but rather the    resource levels required to sustain oversight and coordination. By contrast,    many respondents indicated that the role of NRCan-P4PO could be reduced now    that accommodations are in progress and partner departments have built their    own direct relationships with Indigenous groups. </p>
<p>Indigenous respondents agreed that there is a need for a    “single window” to coordinate engagement, particularly given the size and    resources of the GOC as compared to Indigenous groups. They also underscored    the need for a consistent team (with low staff turnover) so that meaningful    relationships and trust could be cultivated. While recognising that the    current model was not ideal, neither federal nor Indigenous respondents    identified alternatives to the engagement approach. </p>
</div>
<p>The evaluation examined  whether there is an ongoing need for NRCan’s P4PO and/or SPC teams given  progress on achieved to date by the proponent on construction schedule and  departments on implementation of Phase IV initiatives.</p>
<h3><strong>NRCan and partner departments generally agree on the continued  need for the TMX Phase IV coordination structures</strong><strong>.</strong></h3>
<p>Most key informants indicated there  was an ongoing need for the NRCan-TMX coordination structures to support work  required to complete implementation of accommodation measures. Federal  respondents agreed that where responsibility for  coordination is ultimately located is not important, provided it continues to  ensure the Crown’s commitments made during Phase III consultations and Phase IV  are being met. While each member of the federal family has its own specific  mandate/role, most respondents indicated that NRCan may currently be best  placed to lead on coordination across departments.<sup id="fn9-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn9"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>9</a></sup></p>
<p>The need for  federal coordination on TMX could endure for an extended period. Most  departments perceived an ongoing need for whole-of-government coordination at  least as long as the accommodation measures are still being implemented and/or  construction is ongoing. However, most also extended the need for a  coordination function for the transition from construction to operation (next  5-10 years). The need for a dedicated regulatory-focused function of NRCan-SPC  was perceived to diminish once the project is completed, the pipeline  operational and the emphasis on coordination shifts from policy and regulation  to operations and maintenance. However, a few departments perceived that there  will likely still be a requirement to revisit TMX’s regulatory and policy  environments at intervals.</p>
<p>An  unexpected theme that emerged from the interviews with the federal key  informants relates to the corporate knowledge that was gathered through the  implementation of the Phase IV coordination activities. NRCan-SPC and NRCan-P4PO  were perceived by some to have developed corporate knowledge (e.g., repositories  of Indigenous contact information, key issues faced by Indigenous groups and their  resolution, etc.) that needs to be preserved. This could serve as a baseline  for any new initiative, provided that this information was centralized and  updated. </p>
<h3><strong>There is stronger  support towards maintaining NRCan-SPC than NRCan-P4PO. </strong></h3>
<p>NRCan-SPC  was perceived to facilitate oversight and accountability on the TMX project as  a whole, ensure commitments are collectively being met and risks are mitigated,  and coordinate discussion and dispute resolution on cross-cutting issues. As  shown in Figure 11, there was strong support for this ongoing role among surveyed departmental  coordinators, with almost 68% indicating an ongoing need. The strongest  support came from ECCC. Engagement leads and respondents from other departments  were either unsure or equally split between those supporting and rejecting an  ongoing need for coordination. Some suggested that departments that are  adequately resourced could provide similar coordination via their own departmental  TMX Secretariats.</p>

<p>Source: Evaluation Survey</p>
<p>For  senior managers, the key question relates not to continued need for NRCan-SPC  but rather the resource levels required to sustain oversight and coordination. While  they indicated processes could be streamlined, few interviewees perceived that  a significant decrease in coordination would be appropriate at this stage of  project implementation. A few respondents  (particularly those responsible for marine initiatives) underscored the important contribution of these  initiatives to broader GOC objectives (e.g., marine safety). Ensuring  that these objectives are delivered in a coordinated manner is perceived to  contribute to reconciliation.  </p>
<p>There is weaker support for the continued need of the  functions fulfilled by NRCan-P4PO. While nearly all respondents (both within  and external to NRCan) indicated that they perceived an ongoing need for all or  part of its role in federal coordination, they were divided on whether there  was an ongoing need for its in Indigenous engagement now that OGDs have built  their own direct relationships with Indigenous groups. Many respondents  indicated that NRCan-P4PO’s direct role in engagement could be reduced. There  were also  differences in perspective among departments, with less support for this  ongoing engagement role from CCG and almost no support from DFO. </p>
<h3>Indigenous  groups perceived an ongoing need for (stronger) federal coordination on  engagement. </h3>
<p>Many groups (50% or above) agreed that a “single window” was  a good concept and indicated a need for this sort of coordination, particularly  given the size and resources of the GOC as compared to Indigenous groups. They  perceived that this would simplify the process for groups. Respondents for several  groups indicated that in a (real or perceived) absence of this role, they  needed to hire consultants to help them coordinate participation. However, only  one Indigenous respondent saw the current role of NRCan-P4PO as redundant to that  currently played by departments leading the TMX accommodation measures. A few respondents  suggested that NRCan-P4PO could play a larger role in improving engagement  approaches across partner departments. However, respondents also underscored  the need for a “solid team” with low staff turnover so that meaningful  relationships and trust could be cultivated; they perceived NRCan-P4PO to be  insufficiently resourced to be able to do so. A few respondents stated that if  NRCan-P4PO continued to function as it is, they did not see the value of it. </p>
<p>While recognising that the current model was not ideal,  neither federal nor Indigenous respondents identified alternatives to the  present engagement approach.</p>
<h2 id="12">What We Found: Lessons Learned</h2>
<div class="well bg-success">
<h3><strong>Summary of Key Findings:</strong>
</h3>
<p>The evaluation has identified the areas for improvement    that could support ongoing delivery of TMX Phase IV (e.g., clearer    delineation of roles and responsibilities, increased sustainability of    federal workload, improved coordination for Indigenous engagement). These are    highlighted where relevant throughout this report.</p>
<p>The evaluation also    identified lessons related to engagement post-decision on major projects, as    well as a need to manage the precedent set by TMX and further advance    reconciliation with Indigenous peoples. These lessons learned do not lead to easy solutions but are also not    unique to TMX. Related lessons learned from current and past program reviews    should be reviewed collectively and shared across the federal government to    inform future initiatives. </p>
</div>
<p>Throughout this  report, the evaluation has identified the areas for improvement that could  support ongoing delivery of TMX Phase IV and benefit decision-making on future  natural resources projects. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Horizontal Governance.</strong> NRCan’s responsibility for coordination does  not match its authority. It is important that there be leadership, direction,  and support to create a united vision/approach across departments. There is thus a need to improve the  definition and internal communication of roles and responsibilities to ensure  effective coordination and implementation of federal TMX initiatives. To  minimize conflicts, this would include clearer delineation of where NRCan has  the responsibility to give direction and where it has the lead in the dispute  resolution process, as well as clearly defining how all OGDs are expected to  contribute to this process (including timely approval of public communication  products). Through a review of relevant evaluations and lessons learned  documents (Appendix 4), the evaluation identified a best practice in effective  coordination to provide the lead department with a more robust mandate to  reduce overlap and duplication with other departments. It is also key to  provide the lead department with authority to facilitate the achievement of the  intended outcomes without interfering with partner departments' legislative  roles and responsibilities.</li>
<li><strong>NRCan Roles and Responsibilities</strong>. Evidence suggests there may be a need to improve linkages between NRCan-TMX  (P4PO) and IPO-W, responsible for the TMX-IAMC. NRCan respondents  indicated that improvements in the Nòkwewashk sector’s internal organization  are ongoing. </li>
<li><strong>Federal  Workload. </strong>The level of effort / resources required within partner  departments to support coordination needs to be more sustainable. This could be  achieved by either increasing resources and/or streamlining activities. Suggestions  for how this could be achieved included:
<ul>
<li>Reduce NRCan’s weekly report to senior  management to bi-weekly or quarterly.</li>
<li>Provide an advance view of workload expectations  across departments that support coordination of Phase IV implementation.</li>
<li>Improve timing for distribution of materials to  working level committees. </li>
<li>Review internal tools and processes (e.g., frequency  and mix of coordination products) to reduce burden, avoid duplication, and  provide a more holistic view of (timing for) expected input. </li>
<li>OGDs can also review their internal structure to  ensure that funding requests are aligned with expected resource needs.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>NRCan-TMX has been responsive to this feedback. As of May  2022, reports to senior management have switched to bi-weekly updates. As of  July 2022, an internal review and streamlining along with a forward calendar were  also now in the final stages of implementation. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Communications. </strong>There is a need for more timely, targeted communication tools and  content for both internal and external products. GOC respondents further indicated  that external communications should be proactive  and guided by a defined (interdepartmental) strategy, with clearer delineation  of roles and responsibilities. </li>
<li><strong>IT Challenges.</strong> NRCan and partner departments need to  collaborate to ensure that input to tools is accurate and updated. This would  be facilitated by better access to IT solutions shared across departments, and  the direction and skills to use these effectively. </li>
<li><strong>Indigenous  Engagement. </strong>All  lines of evidence agree that GOC needs to  improve the way it coordinates engagement with Indigenous groups. While many  suggestions for improvement are beyond the current scope of TMX Phase IV  implementation (see lessons learned, below), interviews identified a few  improvements that could be actioned immediately. This includes suggestions to  create and promote more opportunities to build Indigenous groups’ access to the  resources and skills required to liaise effectively with the GOC and maximize  the use and benefits of accommodation measures. It also includes suggestions  for relationship building which would necessitate ensuring the continuity of  key contacts (or an approach to mitigate the impact of staff turnover).</li>
<li><strong>Performance  Metrics. </strong>GOC respondents were of the view that NRCan’s current performance  metrics for TMX Phase IV coordination focused on administrative outcomes (e.g.,  number of meetings or outreaches) that are not meaningful for Indigenous groups. </li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>The evaluation  highlighted key lessons learned for future major projects.</strong></h3>
<p>Key informants identified  several lessons they have learned from the early implementation of the TMX Phase  IV that could be applied to current and future government initiatives. These  include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Engagement  post-decision. </strong>While a substantive level of effort may not always be  required, TMX Phase IV has demonstrated that there is a lot of work that can be  done post-decision on major projects. This would be guided by the degree to  which accommodations are offered or the extent to which the government has  committed to implement other programming (such as recommendations) in support  of a project decision. Lessons learned from the coordination of TMX implementation could  be used to help guide project management on how to resource future  post-decision activities, and critical tools or processes to put in place (e.g.,  public communication strategy). There may also be lessons learned specific to  engagement, including on how to engage with non-s.35 rights holding Indigenous groups.  Specific to NRCan-P4PO, there is some concern within NRCan and partner  departments that there will be a loss of corporate knowledge / expertise that  was built if not somehow captured.</li>
<li><strong>TMX precedent. </strong>Most federal respondents perceived the need for horizontal  coordination on major projects to be increasing. Major natural resources  projects are a key issue for reconciliation. Indigenous groups have increasing  expectations for effective and efficient delivery (and accountability to  demonstrate that this has occurred). TMX has created a very large process, with  a strong oversight mechanism. However, several GOC respondents perceived that  extending this model to other major projects would be cost-prohibitive. They  see a risk that TMX may set a precedent that is not sustainable. </li>
<li><strong>Reconciliation.</strong> NRCan is the lead department for TMX but it is  not its role to be a central portal for Indigenous reconciliation writ large, in  the broader GOC agenda. However, there is still a need for coordination to see  that these issues are addressed. There is thus an ongoing need for the GOC to  be more efficient in its engagements with Indigenous groups; it is paramount to  work collaboratively with and leverage the expertise of other federal  organizations and with provincial/territorial governments. This will require  additional innovation and different approaches that enable strong coordination  without slowing down implementation. <br/>The relationship with Indigenous groups also needs  to be consistent, positive, and meaningful (attitude matters). Indigenous groups  are still building their capacity to engage effectively and there is thus also  a need to provide groups with enough resources to support self-empowerment and  full participation into TMX-related opportunities. This includes building on  existing strengths and facilitating the development of necessary skill sets and  relationships to effectively address existing and emerging social, economic,  cultural, and political realities such that Indigenous peoples can realize a  sustainable future from their lands and resources based on their goals and  priorities.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Good internal  and external communication is critical. </strong>Open, transparent, and  respectful communication is important to build consensus on cross-cutting  issues among departments. It is important that departmental coordinators are  linked into the programs, e.g., by attending meetings hosted by those  implementing the accommodation measures. Horizontal awareness of the issues  discussed is important to inform the work of coordinators and to help programs  avoid issues. In developing external communication products, coordinators need  to make sure they understand the material or rely on the experts to provide  wording.</li>
</ul>
<p>These lessons learned do not lead to easy solutions. Previous  program reviews, including those related to major projects management and  impact assessment and regulatory processes, indicate that that both engagement  of Indigenous peoples in major projects and coordination of multiple  departments are challenging and that the issues encountered by TMX Phase IV are  not unique (see examples in Appendix 4). While the perceived need for  horizontal coordination on major projects is increasing, to date they have  faced persistent issues related to clarity of roles and responsibilities,  meaningfulness of performance metrics, challenges with staffing and underestimation  of time required for project delivery, and inconsistent engagement and  communications approaches leading to engagement fatigue. Overarching  recommendations generally agree with suggestions made above to address areas  for improvement on TMX. Lessons learned from this evaluation or other reviews  and stock taking exercises completed for TMX Phase IV implementation should be reviewed  collectively and shared across the federal government to inform future  initiatives.</p>
<h2 id="13">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Overall, the evaluation found that the roles of NRCan’s TMX  coordination structures align with planned design and that they have been  relatively well defined and consistent, despite changes made to account for  evolving roles. There is a continued need for the TMX Phase IV coordination and  to preserve the corporate knowledge built during the implementation of TMX  Phase IV. This need will endure at least as long as the accommodation measures  are still being implemented and/or construction is ongoing. While NRCan may currently  be best placed to lead on coordination across departments, where the  coordination function is located is not perceived to be as important as ensuring  that the Crown’s commitments made during Phase III consultations and Phase IV  are being met.</p>
<p>NRCan-SPC has created effective tools and processes to  support federal coordination. Key governance bodies are well supported. While  consensus on decisions was not always possible, NRCan-SPC is perceived to be  open and transparent in working to resolve cross-cutting issues in the face of  divergent views. The team’s regulatory function is generally perceived as being  effective in fulfilling its intended role. However, there are issues related to  efficiency. Partner departments perceive workload related to TMX coordination,  including processes used to create and update coordination products, as  unsustainable. They report having underestimated the level of effort that would  be required for coordination and reporting.</p>
<p>Federal respondents largely agreed that NRCan-P4PO has to  some extent been effective in its federal coordination role, but not in  engagement. While evidence also suggests that NRCan-P4PO has met its  performance targets for initial outreach and engagement, these metrics do not  provide information on the meaningfulness of engagement. NRCan-P4PO has not  fully fulfilled its planned role as a “single window” for Indigenous  engagement. As a result, while partner departments have worked to develop or  maintain relationships with implicated Indigenous groups, the federal approach  to engagement on TMX has not been effective in reducing engagement fatigue.  When compared to other GOC initiatives, Indigenous respondents indicated that TMX  Phase IV implementation did not stand out as a model of coordination on  engagement.</p>
<p>There is evidence that NRCan-TMX has been responsive to some  factors within the program’s sphere of influence that were likely to impede  effectiveness and efficiency. Nevertheless, the evaluation has identified areas  for improvement (e.g., clearer delineation of roles and responsibilities,  increased sustainability of federal workload, improved coordination for  Indigenous engagement). These are highlighted where relevant throughout this  report.</p>
<p>The evaluation also identified lessons related to engagement  post-decision on major projects, as well as a need to manage the precedent set  by TMX and further advance reconciliation with Indigenous peoples. These  lessons learned do not lead to easy solutions but are also not unique to TMX. Related  lessons learned from current and past program reviews should be reviewed  collectively and shared across the federal government to inform future  initiatives.</p>

<h2 id="15">Appendix 2:   Evaluation’s Indigenous Engagement </h2>
<p>Recognizing the importance of Indigenous perspectives to  inform the relevance and performance of TMX Phase IV implementation, the  evaluation considered Indigenous engagement as a separate line of evidence.</p>
<p>The evaluation expected challenges and potential limitations  in data collection related to Indigenous perspectives. It planned to remain  flexible and use a combination of activities to offer respondents different  avenues to provide their input and share their views. To maximize  participation, it used NRCan’s existing engagement opportunities to promote the  evaluation. This included: </p>
<ul>
<li>A presentation about the evaluation to the TMX-  IAMC in August 2021;<sup id="fn10-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn10"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>10</a></sup></li>
<li>An announcement about the evaluation included in  the P4PO’s August 2021 newsletter to Indigenous groups, with information on how  to contact the evaluation team; and</li>
<li>An announcement about the evaluation posted on  the P4PO’s new TMX Indigenous Portal, including a link to a short online survey  and information on how Indigenous groups could otherwise participate. The  survey was open for response from October 26 to November 30, 2021.</li>
</ul>
<p>There was no additional data collected through any of these  initiatives. The option to conduct focus groups or sharing circles was also  discussed but dismissed given the major disruption to Indigenous groups in  British Columbia caused by forest fire and then flooding events in late 2021.  Data collected related to Indigenous perspectives was thus limited to  interviews, with a couple written responses received by e-mail.</p>
<p>The evaluation set a target of obtaining perspectives from  30 of the 129 Indigenous groups (23.3%). A subset  of 50 groups was randomly selected from the 129 involved in the TMX  accommodation measures. This list was reviewed to ensure it was a reasonable  representation of implicated groups (e.g., region, depth of consultation, etc.)  and to exclude any groups that had requested not to be contacted by NRCan-P4PO.  As a result, the final number in this initial sample was 49. </p>
<p>These Indigenous groups were invited to participate in  interviews via two rounds of outreach by the consultants hired by the evaluation  team: 1) from October to December 2021 (28 Indigenous groups were contacted),  and 2) from January to February 2022 (21 Indigenous groups were contacted).<sup id="fn11-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn11"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>11</a></sup> Respondents were also given the option to provide written responses to the interview  guide and, in second outreach, a short email survey. The evaluation team worked  with NRCan-P4PO to ensure that contact information was up-to-date, and that the  evaluation reached the right individuals or their delegates to speak on behalf  of the community. The first two rounds of outreach resulted in a total of 10  interviews.</p>
<p>In a final attempt to increase response rates, the evaluation  team conducted a third outreach in March 2022. The third outreach involved a  targeted sample of 15 Indigenous groups with whom NRCan-P4PO indicated that it  had the most interaction and/or it deemed most likely to participate in the  evaluation. These respondents were again offered several means to provide  feedback: virtual one-on-one interview with the consultants, written response  to a short e-mail survey, or a together as a virtual workshop that would be led  by the consultants. While these groups were initially contacted by NRCan-P4PO  to request their participation, all follow-ups were conducted by the evaluation  team. It was made clear at all phases of engagement that responses collected  for the evaluation were to be sent directly to the evaluation team and were not  to be shared directly with P4PO. This final outreach resulted in two additional  interviews.</p>
<p>In total, the evaluation received input from representatives  in 12 Indigenous groups (9.3% of the 129 or 40% of the evaluation’s target). In  addition to possible engagement fatigue, participation was likely impacted by  the timing of evaluation. Contextual factors (e.g., ongoing COVID-19, natural  disasters, residential school discoveries, the 2021 federal election, numerous  band elections) coincided with the data collection phase of the evaluation. </p>
<p>All participating respondents were from British Columbia; none  were from Alberta. However, the mix of actual respondents was otherwise  relatively well distributed across the nature of accommodation measures  (terrestrial or marine) and past level of engagement with NRCan-P4PO. </p>

<p>In 2021 Horizontal Evaluation of World Class Tanker Safety  System (WCTSS).</p>
<ul>
<li>The WCTSS intended results were not well  understood during the program design and made it difficult to assess  effectiveness.</li>
<li>The implementation of the WCTSS suffered due to  challenges with staffing, the underestimation of the time required to draft key  policy / funding documents, and the volume of distinct projects.</li>
<li>Collaboration within the federal government for  WCTSS initiatives could have been strengthened through a shared lexicon and an  enhanced strategic perspective.</li>
<li>Partnership with Indigenous communities could  have been improved through a more coordinated and strategic approach to ensure  meaningful engagement.</li>
<li>Some of the factors that fostered an effective  partnership include having a common understanding of (1) shared objectives and  alignment with individual organizational objectives, (2) decision-making processes,  and (3) the role of each partnership.</li>
<li>Engagement approaches and communications were  inconsistent, which in some instances led to engagement fatigue and confusion.</li>
<li>The WCTSS lacked a clear governance structure  for engagement. Consultations with Indigenous communities were variably led by  the national headquarters, regional offices, and different departments.  This contributed to engagement fatigue.</li>
</ul>
<p>In 2020 Evaluation of West Coast  Energy Infrastructure Initiative (WCEI):</p>
<ul>
<li>Mixed views were expressed about the  effectiveness of the WCEI governance structure, the single-window approach and  the decision-making processes regarding funding.</li>
<li>WCEI are facilitated by the horizontal model  where information and proposals were shared between federal departments and the  government of British Columbia. However, many respondents were unclear as to  the exact role of IPO-West.</li>
<li>There is value in a single-window approach for  Indigenous engagement on West Coast energy projects and NRCan has developed a  body of knowledge on how Indigenous communities can be engaged in this context,  and that body of knowledge should be documented.</li>
<li>The whole-of-government approach is maximized  when all departments involved are clear about the new roles and  responsibilities of each department in relation to their mandate, as well as  potential risk of internal and external duplications.</li>
<li>Different mandates and criteria amongst  departments may create barriers to timely decisions.</li>
</ul>
<p>In 2019 Applying Lessons from the  Work of IPO-West:</p>
<ul>
<li>Work in multilateral fora is critical and complements,  but does not replace, bilateral relationships.</li>
<li>For projects that touch many communities, or  projects in areas with shared or overlapping territories/jurisdictions, the  aggregation of diverse communities and partners enables parties to address  common priorities and system-level issues.</li>
<li>Having a separate convenor helps preserve the  independence of participating regulators and the positions of proponents, while  supporting them in piloting new ways of working with Indigenous peoples.</li>
<li>Access to resources is required to facilitate  joint planning, consensus-based decision-making, management of sensitive issues  and inclusive participation of successful partnership-based engagement.</li>
</ul>
<p>In 2018 Evaluation of Indigenous  Partnership West (IPO-West):</p>
<ul>
<li>There was initially some confusion as to the  role of IPO-West and that of other departments.</li>
<li>Some stakeholders expressed concerns about the  timeliness of funding decisions. Decision-making approach involving multiple  departments may be inefficient and not inclusive of partner departments.</li>
<li>Multiple meetings/committees can be  time-consuming, and may create fatigue, overlap and duplication. Back-and-forth  between partner departments can be time- and resource- intensive.</li>
</ul>

<p>  On March 29, 2022, the former Indigenous Affairs and Reconciliation and Major Projects Management Sector was renamed Nòkwewashk (No-kwe-wahshk), one of several Algonquin words for sweetgrass. Over the period of evaluation, this sector has undergone significant restructuring. Program governance presented here is aligned to the most recent structure of Nòkwewashk.</p>
