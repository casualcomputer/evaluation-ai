<h2 id="h2.0.4">Executive summary</h2>
<p>The Canada-Ontario Labour Market Development Agreement (LMDA) is a bilateral agreement between Canada and Ontario for the design and delivery of Employment Benefits and Support Measures (EBSMs). </p>
<p>The objective of EBSMs is to assist individuals to obtain or keep employment through various active employment programs, including training or employment assistance services. Successful delivery of EBSMs is expected to result in participants receiving needed services, a quick return to work, and savings to the Employment Insurance (EI) account. </p>
<p>Programs and services delivered by provinces and territories have to correspond to the EBSM categories defined under the <em>EI Act</em>. The following is a short description of the EBSMs examined in the evaluation of the Canada-Ontario LMDA:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Skills Development (SD) </strong>helps participants obtain employment skills by giving them financial assistance in order select, arrange, and pay for training </li>
<li><strong>Job Placement with Incentive (JPI) </strong>helps participants obtain on-the-job work experience by providing employers with a wage subsidy </li>
<li><strong>Ontario Job Creation Partnerships (OJCP) </strong>support projects that provide eligible participants with opportunities to gain meaningful work experience while providing community benefit </li>
<li><strong>Employment Assistance Services (EAS) </strong>such as job search services, career development and counselling, and résumé writing assistance support individuals as they prepare to enter or re-enter the workforce or assist them to find a better job </li>
<li><strong>Labour Market Partnerships</strong> assist employers, communities and/or industries to address their labour force adjustments and human resource needs by enabling employers, employee or employer associations, community groups, and communities to work together to develop or implement strategies</li>
<li><strong>Research and Innovation</strong> supports innovation in the employment and training system and the exploration of new ways to provide employment and training supports for job seekers, workers and employers including for those not currently supported through the LMDA</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2.0.4.1">The LMDA investment</h3>
<p>In fiscal year 2020 to 2021, Canada transferred $741 million (including about $57 million in administration funds) to Ontario. </p>
<p>Table i provides an overview of the share of funding allocated to EBSMs and the average cost per participant. The average cost per participant is calculated based on the 2010 to 2012 data from the EI Monitoring and Assessment Reports. The 2010 to 2012 period corresponds with the cohort of participants selected for incremental impacts and cost-benefit analysis. </p>

<li><span class="h6"><strong>Note:</strong> Total spending do not add up to 100% due to rounding. Self-employment programming accounted for 7% of spending in the 2010 to 2012 period.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Compared to the 2010 to 2012 period, there was variation in the LMDA budget allocation of some programs and services in 2020 to 2021. For example, investments in SD deceased from 43% to 24%, while those in Research and Innovation increased from 0% to 14%.</p>
<h3 id="2.0.4.2">Evaluation objectives</h3>
<p>Building on the success of previous LMDA evaluation cycles, the aim of this evaluation is to fill in knowledge gaps about the effectiveness, efficiency, as well as and design and delivery of EBSMs in Ontario. </p>
<h3 id="2.0.4.3">Evaluation methodology</h3>
<p>The findings in this report are drawn from 7 separate evaluation studies carried out at the provincial level. These studies examine issues related to program effectiveness, efficiency, and design and delivery. A mix of qualitative and quantitative methods are used, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>incremental impact analysis for participants who began an intervention between 2010 and 2012</li>
<li>outcome analysis</li>
<li>cost-benefit analysis (including savings to health care)</li>
<li>key informant interviews with 31 provincial representatives, service providers, agreement holders and key stakeholders  </li>
<li>questionnaires completed by provincial officials</li>
<li>document and literature reviews</li>
</ul>
<p>The incremental impacts are estimated for 2 types of EI claimants:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>active EI claimants</strong> are participants who started an EBSM intervention while collecting EI benefits</li>
<li><strong>former EI claimants</strong> are participants who started an EBSM intervention up to 3 years after the end of their EI benefits<sup id="fn3-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn3"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>3</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2.0.4.4">Key findings</h3>
<p>Nearly 411,800 EI active and former claimants began participating in Canada-Ontario LMDA programs and services between 2010 and 2012.</p>
<h4>Effectiveness and efficiency of EBSMs</h4>
<p>Overall, incremental impacts demonstrate that participation in most EBSMs improves labour market attachment and reduces dependence on government income support compared to similar non-participants. This excludes former claimants who participated in SD. </p>
<p>With the exception of former claimants who participated in SD, these results are consistent with those found for earlier cohorts of participants as part of the previous evaluation cycle.</p>
<p>A subgroup analyses shows that, with some exceptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>SD and EAS improved the labour market attachment and reduced the dependence on income support for most subgroups of active EI claimant participants </li>
<li>JPI improved the labour market attachment and reduced the dependence on income support for female, male, and youth former claimant participants</li>
<li>OJCP improved the labour market attachment and reduced the dependence on income support for female active claimant participants, but had mixed results for former claimants</li>
</ul>
<p>Over time, the social benefits of participating in JPI, OJCP and EAS exceeded the initial investment costs for program participants. However, it takes 19.1 years to recover the initial investment in SD for active claimants. The investments in SD for former claimants may not be recovered <sup id="fn4-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn4"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>4</a></sup></p>
<p>Chart i presents the incremental impacts on the incidence of employment for active and former claimants by EBSM. The estimates can be interpreted as a change in the probability of being employed following participation. For example, participation in SD increases the probability of being employed by 4.3 percentage points for active EI claimants relative to similar non-participants.</p>

<h3 id="2.0.4.5">Supplemental studies</h3>
<p>A series of supplemental studies addresses information gaps previously identified in LMDA evaluations regarding the design and delivery, challenges and lessons learned for OJCP, Labour Market Partnerships and Research and Innovation. </p>
<p>Excluding OJCP, these interventions are not suitable for incremental impact analysis. For example, Labour Market Partnerships and Research and Innovation do not collect participant information. As a result, a mix of qualitative and quantitative methods are used to examine these EBSMs in detail. When relevant, key considerations are included to help guide future program and policy discussions.</p>
<h4>Ontario Job Creation Partnerships study</h4>
<p>The design and delivery of OJCP allows the Ontario to address a variety of barriers to employment experienced by its residents. OJCP can also be used to address labour market needs by targeting sub-groups of individuals, in-demand professions or economic sectors, and specific communities.</p>
<p>In addition to gaining work experience, key informants identified a variety of other benefits that can be expected from OJCP projects. For example, participants are expected to develop work-related skills, enhance their job search abilities and improve their personal well-being. </p>
<p>Project holders can benefit from OJCP by increasing their organizational capacity, implementing their projects and expanding the portfolio of services they provide. At the community level, projects can support the local economy and provide new assets, such as restored infrastructure and new recreational spaces.</p>
<h4>Labour Market Partnerships study </h4>
<p>The Labour Market Partnerships program(s) aim to assist employers, communities and/or industries to address their labour force adjustments and human resource needs. Funded projects target current and/or forecasted skills and/or labour shortages. These projects also target unemployment in specific subpopulations such as women, youth, Indigenous people, newcomers, persons with disabilities, the self-employed, and those who will soon be laid-off. </p>
<p>Ontario program officials confirmed that regional/local program officials carried out activities to support the formation and maintenance of partnerships (with sector and community stakeholders) as a part of the LMP programs design and delivery. Key informants noted that partners' expertise, network and financial contribution are all essential or beneficial to project implementation and success.</p>
<h4>Research and Innovation study</h4>
<p>In Ontario, Research and Innovation is used to enable innovation in the employment and training system and to explore new ways of providing employment and training supports to employers, workers, and job seekers, including those who are not currently supported by other LMDA funded programs and services.</p>
<p>The document review revealed that Research and Innovation projects encompassed a variety of activities including:</p>
<ul>
<li>developing new tools and approaches to meet the labour market needs of employers and job seekers </li>
<li>supporting labour force development projects in remote Indigenous communities </li>
<li>supporting employer-driven training </li>
<li>pilot projects implementing and assessing new training and skills development approaches </li>
<li>academic research on labour market outcomes </li>
</ul>
<p>Provincial/territorial questionnaires reveal factors contributing to successful testing and identification of innovative approaches, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>tailoring approaches to particular sectors</li>
<li>developing strategic partnerships between organizations in different sectors, including workforce development service providers, post-secondary institutions, and employers</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Skills  Development</strong>-Apprentices study</h4>
<p>The objective of the program is to help apprentices become skilled tradespeople and to increase their labour market attachment. Program participants have generally chosen a career and are already attached to the labour market. The apprenticeship process involves on-the-job learning and technical training in a classroom setting. </p>
<p>The evaluation found that active EI claimants increased their average earnings from $18,448 in the fifth year pre-program to $56,257 in the fifth year after the program start year. Former EI claimants increased their average earnings from $20,125 in the fifth year pre-program to $55,581 in the fifth year after the program start year. After participating in the program, both active and former claimants also decreased their dependence on government income support. </p>
<h3 id="2.0.4.6">Recommendations</h3>
<p>Since 2012, 15 qualitative and quantitative studies addressed issues and questions related to EBSM design, delivery and effectiveness. The quantitative studies successfully assessed the effectiveness and efficiency of EBSMs by producing incremental impacts and cost-benefit analysis. The qualitative studies identified specific challenges, lessons learned and best practices associated with the design and delivery of EBSMs. Each study included key considerations for program and policy development or recommendations.</p>
<p>In addition, the recently completed evaluation of the Workforce Development Agreements complements the LMDA qualitative studies. This evaluation was also supported by literature reviews and provided unique insights into challenges and lessons learned to assist persons with disabilities, immigrants and those further removed from the labour market.</p>
<p>Most results from this evaluation stem from the conduct of advance causal analysis whereby impacts found could be attributed to a specific EBSM. These analyses are predicated on having access to high quality administrative records, thereby confirming the importance of the capacity to leverage and integrate relevant administrative data.</p>
<p>From these main findings, 2 key recommendations emerge.</p>
<h4>Recommendation #1</h4>
<p>Ontario is encouraged to share and discuss lessons learned, best practices and challenges associated with the design and delivery of programs and services. Discussions are encouraged with ESDC, at the bilateral or multilateral levels as well as with service delivery network if necessary.</p>
<h4>Recommendation #2</h4>
<p>Ontario is encouraged to pursue efforts to maintain and strengthen data collection provisions in support of reporting, performance measurement and data-driven evaluations at the national and provincial levels.</p>

<p>Ontario thanks the Evaluation Directorate of ESDC and the Evaluation Steering Committee for their diligence, dedication and commitment towards the third cycle of the evaluation process. As before, Ontario worked in close collaboration with the Evaluation Directorate of ESDC during the planning and implementation of the third cycle for the Labour Market Development Agreement (LMDA) evaluation.</p>
<p>The findings from the 7 qualitative and quantitative studies on Employment Benefits and Support Measures (EBSM) provide valuable insights and guidance for program development and efforts are under way to incorporate necessary changes and further refinements in data collection and data sharing protocols.</p>
<p>Ontario reviewed and agrees with the findings of the third cycle evaluation of the Canada-Ontario LMDA, which concluded that:</p>
<ul>
<li>overall, incremental impacts demonstrate that participation in most EBSMs improves labour market attachment and reduces dependence on government income support compared to similar non-participants. This excludes former claimants who participated in Skills Development (SD) </li>
<li>with the exception of former claimants who participated in SD, these results are consistent with those found for earlier cohorts of participants as part of the previous evaluation cycle</li>
<li>a subgroup analysis shows that, with some exceptions:
        <ul>
<li>SD and EAS improved the labour market attachment and reduced the dependence on income support for most subgroups of active EI claimant participants </li>
<li>Job Placement with Incentive (JPI) improved the labour market attachment and reduced the dependence on income support for female, male, and youth former claimant participants</li>
<li>Ontario Job Creation Partnership (OJCP) improved the labour market attachment and reduced the dependence on income support for female active claimant participants but had mixed results for former claimants</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>over time, the social benefits of participating in JPI, OJCP and EAS exceeded the initial investment costs for program participants. However, it takes 19.1 years to recover the initial investment in SD for active claimants. The investments in SD for former claimants may not be recovered<sup id="fn5-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn5"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>5</a></sup></li>

<p>Ontario submits the management responses below to the recommendations in the report: </p>
<h3 id="2.0.5.2">Management response to key recommendations </h3>
<h4>Recommendation #1 </h4>
<p>Ontario is encouraged to share and discuss lessons learned, best practices and challenges associated with the design and delivery of programs and services. Discussions are encouraged with ESDC, at the bilateral or multilateral levels as well as with service delivery network if necessary.</p>
<h5>Management response</h5>
<ul>
<li>Ontario agrees with the recommendation on the importance of sharing best practices, lessons learned, and challenges associated with the design and delivery of labour market programs</li>
<li>Ontario will continue to share many of its best practices through the Forum of Labour Market Ministers. Additionally, Ontario will continue engaging in regular bilateral meetings of the Workforce Development Committee to assist with sharing information on an ongoing basis with ESDC</li>
<li>Ontario looks forward to working with ESDC and the provinces and territories (P/Ts) to help to ensure the P/Ts can work together on design, delivery and evaluation of their programs and services, and learn from each other's experiences</li>
</ul>
<h4>Recommendation #2</h4>
<p>Ontario is encouraged to pursue efforts to maintain and strengthen data collection provisions in support of reporting, performance measurement and data-driven evaluations at the national and provincial levels.</p>
<h5>Management response</h5>
<ul>
<li>Ontario agrees with the focus on improved data collection, reporting and performance measurement. Ontario has developed and implemented new tools to improve data collection and monitoring:
        <ul>
<li>new digital intake tools, such as the Common Assessment Tool, that improve Ontario's ability to collect important client profile information, such as life stability, self-efficacy, education/employment, disability status, and inclusion group membership </li>
<li>new outcome tracking, such as the Employment Status Questionnaire (ESQ), to improve Ontario's collection of standardized outcome measures for clients of employment and training programs </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ontario will work together with ESDC to improve data collection efforts and enhance client-level data sharing, data linking and analyses so that both are strategically aligned and complement evaluation and continuous improvement of labour market systems and programs funded through the LMDA</li>
<li>Ontario supports sharing data at the national and P/T levels to provide guidelines and help determine benchmarks and will collaborate with ESDC and other P/Ts to enable this work</li>
<li>The recommendation is also satisfied in part via compliance with post-2017 performance measurement framework </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2.0.5.3">Conclusion </h3>
<p>LMDAs are the main annual investment in active labour market programs and services in Canada and the evaluation report provides critical insights on how the effectiveness, efficiency, design and delivery of EBSMs can be further improved.</p>
<p>Ontario is committed to making continuous improvements in the planning, design, and delivery of EBSMs so that it continues to enable individuals to be gainfully employed and benefit from training and employment assistance services as needed. </p>

<h2 id="h2.1">Introduction</h2>
<p>Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC) worked jointly with Ontario and 11 other provinces and territories to carry out the 2018 to 2023 third cycle for the evaluation of the Labour Market Development Agreements (LMDA). </p>
<p>The first LMDA evaluation cycle was carried out from 1998 to 2012 and focused on federally delivered programs and services in Ontario. </p>
<p>Building on lessons learned and best practices from the first cycle, the second cycle of LMDA evaluations was undertaken between 2012 and 2017. The second cycle was designed and implemented under the guidance of a federal-provincial/territorial LMDA Evaluation Steering Committee. The work was supported by bilateral discussions at the Joint Evaluation Committee. </p>
<p>The third LMDA evaluation cycle builds on the success of the second cycle. The aim is to fill in knowledge gaps about the effectiveness, efficiency, and design and delivery of EBSMs. The evaluation cycle was also designed and implemented under the guidance of a federal-provincial/territorial LMDA Evaluation Steering Committee composed of ESDC and 12 participating provinces and territories.</p>
<p>This report presents a summary of the third cycle evaluation findings from 7 studies undertaken as part of the third LMDA evaluation cycle. </p>

<h2 id="h2.2">Canada-Ontario Labour Market Development Agreement</h2>
<p>The Canada-Ontario LMDA is a bilateral agreement between Canada and Ontario for the design and delivery of EBSM programs and services. It was established, along with similar agreements with 12 other provinces and territories, under Part II of the <em>1996 Employment Insurance (EI) Act</em>. </p>
<p>In fiscal year 2020 to 2021, Canada transferred nearly $741.4 million to Ontario.<sup id="fn6-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn6"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>6</a></sup> Under the agreement, Ontario is responsible for the design and delivery of LMDA-funded programs and services aimed at assisting individuals to prepare for, obtain, and maintain employment. </p>
<p>LMDA programs and services are classified under 2 categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Employment benefits</strong><sup id="fn7-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn7"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>7</a></sup><sup>, </sup><sup id="fn8-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn8"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>8</a></sup> fall into 4 subcategories: </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Skills Development</li>
<li>Job Placement with Incentive</li>
<li>Self-Employment</li>
<li>Ontario Job Creation Partnerships</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Support measures</strong> fall into 3 subcategories:</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Employment Assistance Services<sup id="fn9-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn9"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>9</a></sup></li>
<li>Labour Market Partnerships</li>
<li>Research and Innovation</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>Ontario has the flexibility to adapt EBSMs to its provincial context as long as they are consistent with Part II of the <em>EI Act</em>.<sup id="fn10-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn10"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>10</a></sup></p>
<p>The objective of EBSMs is to assist individuals to obtain or keep employment through various active employment programs, including training or employment assistance services. Successful delivery of EBSMs is expected to result in participants receiving needed services, a quick return to work, and savings to the EI account. </p>
<h3 id="2.2.1">Employment benefits</h3>
<p>Employment benefits programs and services examined in this study include: </p>
<p><strong>Skills Development (SD)</strong> provides direct financial assistance to individuals to select, arrange, and pay for training. Training is tailored to the needs of participants through counselling and career orientation. It can include adult-based education, literacy and essential skills, language training, short-term training and occupational training leading to certification from an accredited institution. </p>
<p><strong>Job Placement with Incentive (JPI) </strong>helps participants obtain on-the-job work experience by providing employers with a wage subsidy. The subsidies can range in duration from 16 to 52 weeks, with the maximum level of the subsidy ranging from 50% to 100% of the employee's wage.</p>
<p><strong>Ontario Job Creation Partnerships (OJCP)</strong> support projects that provide eligible participants with opportunities to gain meaningful work experience while providing community benefit. Participants can take part in a finite project for up to 52 weeks.</p>
<h3 id="2.2.2">Support measures</h3>
<p>Support measures programs and services examined in this study include: </p>
<p><strong>Employment Assistance Services (EAS)</strong> include a variety of services that support individuals as they prepare to enter or re-enter the workforce or assist them to find a better job. Services can include job search services, career development and counselling, and résumé writing assistance. These services are referred to as light touch interventions due to their very short duration. They can be provided on a one-on-one basis; or in a group setting. A typical intervention lasts less than 1 day, but a participant may receive multiple short interventions over a few weeks. These services are generally provided in combination with more intensive Employment Benefit interventions. Services may also include case-management, which can have a longer duration. </p>
<p><strong>Labour Market Partnerships </strong>assist employers, communities and/or industries to address their labour force adjustments and human resource needs. They include a wide range of funded activities, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>labour market and human resource research</li>
<li>raising awareness about labour market and human resources information and best practices </li>
<li>employment services and workforce development planning activities</li>
<li>employment and training service coordination for employers</li>
<li>employer-led skills development training</li>
<li>labour force adjustment services</li>
<li>Activities to improve the quality and quantity of experiential learning opportunities available to undergraduate and graduate students</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Research and Innovation</strong> is used to enable innovation in the employment and training system and to explore new ways to provide employment and training supports for job seekers, workers and employers including for those not currently supported through the LMDA. </p>
<h3 id="2.2.3">Eligible participants covered in this study</h3>
<p>The incremental impacts are estimated for active and former EI claimants:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>active claimants</strong> are participants who started an EBSM intervention while collecting EI benefits</li>
<li><strong>former claimants</strong> are participants who started an EBSM intervention up to 3 years after the end of their EI benefits<sup id="fn11-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn11"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>11</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2.2.4">Average EBSM share of funding and cost per Action Plan Equivalent</h3>
<p>Table 1 provides an overview of the share of funding allocated to EBSMs and the average cost per participant. It is noted that the average cost per participant is calculated based on the 2010 to 2012 data from the EI Monitoring and Assessment Reports. The 2010 to 2012 period corresponds with the cohort of participants selected for incremental impacts and cost-benefit analysis in the Canada-Ontario LMDA evaluation.</p>
<p>From the 2010 to 2012 time period to the 2020 to 2021 fiscal year, investments in SD decreased by 19 percentage points. The largest increases in funding are noted for Research and Innovation (+14 percentage points) and Labour Market Partnerships (+8 percentage points).</p>

<h2 id="h2.3">Methodology</h2>
<p>This section presents key aspects of the quantitative analyses carried out as part of the LMDA studies. </p>
<p>All quantitative analyses are based on administrative data from the EI Part I (EI claim data) and Part II (EBSM participation data). The EI Part I and II data are then linked to the T1 and T4 taxation files from the Canada Revenue Agency. Incremental impact and cost-benefit analyses are based on up to 100% of participants in Ontario who began their EBSM participation in 2010 to 2012. </p>
<p>The 2010 to 2012 timeframe was selected in order to assess the impacts of EBSMs in the years following participation. Impacts were assessed over a period of at least 4 years after program completion up to the 2017 calendar year (most recent available information at the time of this evaluation). </p>
<h3 id="2.3.1">Incremental impacts analysis<sup id="fn14-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn14"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>14</a></sup></h3>
<p>Program effectiveness is assessed by estimating incremental impacts from EBSM participation on participants' labour market experience. That is, earnings from employment and self-employment, incidence of employment, use of EI, use of social assistance (SA), and dependence on government income support after participation. </p>
<p>The role of the incremental impact analysis is to isolate the effects of participation from other factors. In order to achieve this, the incremental impact analysis compares the labour market experience of participants before and after their participation with that of similar non-participants. Figure 1 presents an example of incremental impact calculation. </p>
<figure id="figure_1">

<details>
<summary>Text description - Figure 1</summary>
<p>Incremental impacts are the difference in the pre-post participation outcomes between participants and similar non-participants.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>if the average annual earnings of participants are $30,000 before participation and $38,000 after participation, the change in earning for participants is an increase of $8,000</li>
<li>if the average annual earnings in the comparison group are $31,000 before participation and $36,000 after participation, the change in earnings for the comparison group is an increase of $5,000</li>
<li>the incremental impact, that is the change attributed to program participation, is $8,000 minus $5,000, which equals an increase of $3,000</li>
</ul>
</details>
</figure>
<p>The main estimator used is propensity score kernel matching technique combined with difference-in-differences estimator. Moreover, 3 different state-of-the-art estimation techniques (Inverse Probability Weighting, Nearest Neighbour and Cross-sectional Matching) were carried out separately for each type of EBSMs and EI claimants in order to validate the impact estimates. </p>
<p>As for previous LMDA evaluation studies, the Action Plan Equivalent is the unit of analysis used. Action Plan Equivalents regroup all EBSMs received by an individual within less than 6 months between the end of one EBSM and the start of the next. Action Plan Equivalents are categorized based on the longest EBSM they contain, except for EAS-only Action Plan Equivalents which include only EAS interventions. </p>
<p>The analysis includes Action Plan Equivalents that consist only of LMDA interventions. Action Plan Equivalents that include a combination of LMDA and other labour market programs funded by ESDC, were excluded from the participant sample. </p>
<p>The matching of participants and comparison group members used up to 75 socio-demographic and labour market variables observed over 5 years before participation.<sup id="fn15-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn15"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>15</a></sup> Two different comparison groups were used to measure impacts for active and former EI claimants. </p>
<p>For <strong>active claimants,</strong> incremental impacts were measured relative to a comparison group of active claimants who were eligible to, but did not, participate in EBSMs during the reference period. </p>
<p>For <strong>former claimants,</strong> the comparison group was created using individuals who participated in EAS only during the reference period.<sup id="fn16-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn16"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>16</a></sup> In other words, the experience of former claimants in SD, JPI, or OJCP interventions is compared to the experience of former claimants who only received EAS. This is a conservative approach given the fact that participation in an EAS-only intervention can lead to limited effects on labour market outcomes. </p>
<p>Due to this difference in measurement, incremental impacts estimated for active claimant participants should not be directly compared to those of former claimant participants. </p>
<p>Impacts are generated over 4 years for SD, JPI, and OJCP, while a fifth year is estimated for participants in EAS.<sup id="fn17-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn17"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>17</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="2.3.2">Factors accounted for in the cost-benefit analysis<sup id="fn18-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn18"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>18</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup id="fn19-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn19"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>19</a></sup></h3>
<p>Building on the results of the incremental impacts, program efficiency is assessed through a cost-benefit analysis. The analysis compares the participants' cost of participating and the government's cost of delivering the program to the benefits associated with the program. Overall, this analysis provides insights on the extent to which the program is efficient for the society (that is, for both participants and the government).</p>
<h4>Sources of data and information</h4>
<p>The analysis takes into account all the quantifiable costs and benefits directly related to EBSM delivery and participation that can be measured given the information available. The analysis is comprehensive in that it accounts for the vast majority of possible direct costs and benefits.</p>
<p>However, the analysis does not account for all costs and benefits. For example, there are factors that can lead to an understatement of the benefits (for example, positive spillovers to other family members) and other factors that can lead to an overstatement of the benefits (for example, effects on skill prices or displacement).<sup id="fn20-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn20"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>20</a></sup></p>
<p>This study relied on integrated data from the EI Part I and II Databank and Income Tax records from the Canada Revenue Agency. Information about earnings, use of EI, and use of SA was taken from the study of incremental impacts.<sup id="fn21-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn21"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>21</a></sup> The program costs were calculated using information available in the EI Monitoring and Assessment Reports.</p>
<p>Relative to the previous cycle of evaluation, the methodology has been extended to incorporate one of the indirect health benefits associated with increased labour market attachment. In particular, the methodology includes an estimate of the change in public health care cost due to the decline in health care utilization resulting from program participation.</p>
<p>Data on average public healthcare costs by income quintile are taken from the report <em>Lifetime Distributional Effects of Publicly Financed Health Care in Canada </em>(2013) by the Canadian Institute for Health Information. </p>
<p>Program costs are measured using information on LMDA expenditures and new interventions reported in the EI Monitoring and Assessment Report. Other costs and benefits are assessed using integrated administrative data from the EI Part I and II databank and the Canada Revenue Agency.</p>
<p>Incremental impacts measured over the second year of participation and up to 5 post-program years are discounted by 3% to bring them to a common base with the program cost and benefits incurred in the program start year. This 3% rate accounts for the interest the government could have collected if the funds used to pay for the program had been invested. Incremental impacts are estimated using 2010 constant dollars and this accounts for inflation. </p>
<h4>Costs and benefits accounted for in the calculations</h4>
<p><strong>Program cost</strong><strong>:</strong> cost incurred by the government for delivering the program (that is, administration and direct program costs calculated from data reported in the EI Monitoring and Assessment Reports).</p>
<p><strong>Marginal social cost of public funds: </strong>loss incurred by society when raising additional revenues such as taxes to fund government spending. The value is estimated at 20% of the program cost, sales taxes, income taxes, impacts on EI and impacts on SA paid or collected by the government. </p>
<p><strong>Foregone earnings: </strong>estimated net impacts on participants' earnings during the participation period. During labour market program participation, some individuals have lower earnings than what they would have received if they had not participated. </p>
<p><strong>Employment earnings: </strong>incremental impacts on participants' earnings during and after participation. In-program earnings represent the foregone earnings for participants. </p>
<p><strong>Fringe benefits</strong><strong>:</strong> the employer-paid health and life insurance as well as pension contributions. They are estimated at 15% of the incremental impacts on earnings. </p>
<p><strong>Federal and provincial income taxes</strong><strong>:</strong> incremental impacts on federal, provincial and territorial taxes paid by participants. </p>
<p><strong>Sales taxes: </strong>the sales taxes paid by participants estimated as incremental impacts on earnings multiplied by the propensity to consume (97%), the proportion of household spending on taxable goods and services (52%) and the total average federal and provincial sales tax rate (11%). </p>
<p><strong>Social assistance and Employment Insurance benefits collected: </strong>incremental impacts on SA and EI benefits use by participants following participation. </p>
<p><strong>Canada Pension Plan contribution and Employment Insurance premiums: </strong>these contributions and premiums were identified from the Canada Revenue Agency data and then, the incremental impacts on Canada Pension Plan contributions and EI premiums were estimated.</p>
<p><strong>Public health care costs savings: </strong>estimated impact of participation in EBSMs on public health care costs shown as an average change per participant over the post-program period examined. </p>
<h3 id="2.3.3">Strengths and limitations of the studies </h3>
<p>One of the key strengths from the studies is that all quantitative analyses are based on administrative data rather than survey responses. Compared to survey data, administrative data are not subject to recall errors or response bias. </p>
<p>The propensity score models used to match participants and non-participants for the incremental impact analyses are judged to be robust. In part this is because they were based on 5 years of pre-participation data. Moreover, these models are based on a vast array of variables including sociodemographic characteristics, location, skill level related to last occupation, and indicators of labour market attachment.</p>
<p>However, the matching process can be further refined for specific subgroups if the following information is available in the future:</p>
<ul>
<li>persons with disabilities: the type and severity of the disability, and the capacity/willingness to work full-time</li>
<li>recent immigrants: the country of origin, the proficiency in English or French, and the relevance of credentials and work experience</li>
<li>visible minorities: place of birth; individuals who are born outside of Canada face different challenges compared to those born in Canada</li>
</ul>
<p>Refining the matching process for population subgroups could broaden the scope for greater Gender-based Analysis Plus.</p>
<p>Sensitivity analysis and the use of alternative estimation methods have increased confidence in the incremental impact estimates. However, a limitation with the propensity score matching techniques is that no one can be fully sure the impacts are not influenced by factors not captured in the data.</p>
<p>The cost-benefit analysis accounted for all quantifiable costs and benefits directly attributable to the EBSMs and could be estimated with the available administrative data. It is further strengthened by incorporating one of the indirect benefits, which is the change in public health care expenditures associated with program participation. However, the analysis did not account for non-quantifiable factors that can lead to an understatement of the benefits (for example, positive spillovers to other family members) and factors that can lead to an overstatement of the benefits (for example, effects on skill prices or displacement).</p>
<p>In some studies that use qualitative data collection methods, the number of key informants interviewed is relatively small. Responses provided by key informants reflect their own experience and their own region and may not be fully representative of the entire province.</p>

<h3 id="2.4.1">Incremental impacts for active and former EI claimants</h3>
<h4>Main findings</h4>
<p>Overall, incremental impacts demonstrate that participation in most EBSMs improves labour market attachment and reduces dependence on government income support compared to similar non-participants. This excludes former claimants who participated in SD. </p>
<p>With the exception of former claimants who participated in SD, the incremental impact results presented below are generally consistent with those found as part of the second LMDA evaluation cycle.</p>
<p>The incremental impacts presented in this report compare the change in incidence of employment, earnings, use of EI and SA benefits, and dependence on government income support from the pre-program participation period to the post-program participation period for participants relative to similar non-participants. The results reflect the difference between the pre to post-participation change for participants and the change for similar non-participants.</p>
<p>The pre-participation period consists of the 5 years before participation and the post-participation period consists of the 4 years after participation (5 years in the case of EAS).</p>
<h4>Incidence of employment </h4>
<p>Chart 1 presents the incremental impacts on the incidence of employment for active and former claimants by type of program.<sup id="fn23-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn23"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>23</a></sup> The estimates can be interpreted as a change in the probability of being employed following participation.</p>
<p>Active claimants in SD, EAS, JPI and OJCP increased their incidence of employment relative to similar non-participants.

<h4>Use of EI benefits</h4>
<p>As shown in Chart 3, active claimants in SD and EAS reduced their use of EI benefits in the post-program period. Relative to similar participants who only received EAS, former claimants in SD reduced their EI benefits use, while former claimants OJCP increased their use of EI benefits.</p>
<p>From a cost-benefit perspective, the increase in the use of EI by former claimant participants in OJCP is not necessarily a negative impact given their increased employment earnings. Following participation, former claimants are likely to requalify for EI benefits due to their stronger labour market attachment demonstrated by increases in employment and earnings.</p>

<p>Recent interviews with 40 service providers working with persons with disabilities reveal that a significant proportion of participants are looking or only capable of working on part-time basis. In fact, the outcome trends reveal that over 40% of persons with disabilities earn less than $10,000 per year in the 4 post-program years.</p>
<p>In this context, table 15 presents the detailed incremental impacts for persons with disabilities over the 4 years post-participation.

<h3 id="2.4.3">Cost-benefit analysis</h3>
<h4>Main findings</h4>
<p>Over time, the social benefits of participating in JPI, OJCP and EAS exceeded the initial investment costs for program participants. However, it takes 19.1 years to recover the initial investment in SD for active claimants. As well, the investments in SD for former claimants may not be recovered.</p>
<p>This analysis is based on the EBSM medium-term incremental impacts previously described in this report. Costs and benefits are examined over the participation period of 1 or 2 years and 5, or 10 years after the end of participation.<sup id="fn42-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn42"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>42</a></sup></p>
<p>The cost-benefit analysis addresses the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are the benefits from EBSMs exceeding the costs within 5 years (for JPI, OJCP and EAS), or 10 years (for SD) after the end of participation?</li>
<li>How much is the benefit for the government and society if the government spends $1 in EI part II funding? </li>
<li>How many years does it take the benefits to recover the costs?</li>
</ul>
<p>Table 20 presents the cost-benefit results for active and former EI claimant participants. The results are presented from the social perspective, that is, the government and individual perspectives combined. This allows for a sound assessment of program effectiveness in achieving its objectives of helping unemployed individuals to obtain and maintain employment and to generate EI savings. </p>

</ul>
<p>The information below provides examples of the net present value, the benefit-cost ratio, the payback period, the social rate of return and savings to health care costs. </p>
<h4>4.1.1. Skills Development<sup id="fn44-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn44"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>44</a></sup> </h4>
<p>During the 2010 to 2012 period, SD represented approximately 43% of EBSM expenditures under the LMDA in Ontario. The average duration of a SD Action Plan Equivalent is 53 weeks for active claimants and 51 weeks for former claimants. </p>
<p>Table 20 includes the cost-benefit analysis results for active and former EI claimant participants in SD. For example, over the 10 year post-program period, for active EI claimant participants, the investment costs exceeded the benefits by $15,932, yielding a social return on investment of -130%. This means that if the government spends $1 on SD for active EI claimants, it generates a loss of -$0.30 for society.<sup id="fn45-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn45"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>45</a></sup> From a social perspective, it takes 19.1 years for the benefits to recover the costs of programming. Overall, there is a savings to health care costs of $21 per participant. </p>
<h4>4.1.2. Job Placement with Incentive</h4>
<p>During the 2010 to 2012 period, JPI represent 1% of total LMDA-funded EBSM expenditures In Ontario. The average duration of a JPI Action Plan Equivalent is 32 weeks for active claimants and 24 weeks for former claimants. </p>
<p>Table 20 includes the cost-benefit analysis results for active and former EI claimant participants in JPI. For example, over the 5 year post-program period, for former EI claimant participants, the benefit is $14,568 greater than the cost, yielding a social return on investment of 278%. This means that if the government spends $1 on JPI for former claimants, it generates $3.78 of benefit for society. From a societal perspective, the costs were recovered during the first year of program participation. Overall, there is a savings to health care costs of $185 per participant.</p>
<h4>4.1.3. Ontario Job Creation Partnerships</h4>
<p>During the 2010 to 2012 period, OJCP represented 1% of the total EBSM expenditures In Ontario. The average duration of an OJCP Action Plan Equivalent is 37 weeks for active claimants and 31 weeks for former claimants.</p>
<p>In addition to helping participants obtain work experience in the funded projects, OJCP also benefits the communities where the projects are implemented. However, community impacts are not accounted for in this cost-benefit analysis since they are not captured in the administrative data and are difficult to quantify. Accordingly, the benefits from the social perspective are likely underestimated. </p>
<p>Table 20 includes the cost-benefit analysis results for active and former EI claimant participants in OJCP. For example, over the 5 year post-program period, for former EI claimant participants, the benefits of delivering OJCP were $12,804 lower than the costs 5 years after the end of participation, yielding a return on investment of -108%. This means that if the government spends $1 on OJCP programming, it generates an additional loss of $0.08 for society. From a social perspective, it takes 12.4 years to recover the costs of OJCP for former EI claimant participants. Overall, there is a savings to health care costs of $22 per participant.</p>
<h4>4.1.4. Employment Assistance Services<sup id="fn46-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn46"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>46</a></sup></h4>
<p>EAS includes a variety of services such as computer access for job search services, group sessions to prepare for an interview, career counselling, and action plan development. The administrative data, however, do not allow to identify what proportion of EAS interventions belong to each category or the intensity of services offered to participants. </p>
<p>While EAS are often provided with other EBSMs, this analysis examined only participants who received 1 or more EAS without participating in other EBSMs. EAS represented about 46% of total EBSM expenditures between 2010 and 2012. </p>
<p>As shown in Table 20, over the 5 year post-program period, the benefits of delivering EAS were $2,562 lower than the costs 5 years after the end of participation, yielding a return on investment of -77%. This means that if the government spends $1 on EAS programming, society recovers only $0.23 by the fifth year after participation. From a social perspective, it takes 6.6 years to recover the costs of EAS for former EI claimant participants. No savings to health care costs (-33) were found. </p>
<p>Overall, the goal of EAS is not to help participants acquire more skills, therefore, increasing participants' earnings after participation is not necessarily expected. Conducting a cost-benefit analysis for EAS is a challenge as it is not possible to attribute a dollar figure to the return to employment. However, including earnings in the cost-benefit calculation is still very relevant since it captures partially the positive impact of the quicker return to work. </p>

<h3 id="2.5.1">Ontario Job Creation Partnerships<sup id="fn47-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn47"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>47</a></sup></h3>
<h4>Program objective</h4>
<p>The OJCP program is designed to support projects that create jobs that will provide insured participants with opportunities to gain meaningful and recent work experience. Project activities should benefit both the participant and the community; however, the primary focus must be on the participant, not the sponsor or the community.</p>
<p>Participants receive benefits from EI Part I or II.<sup id="fn48-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn48"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>48</a></sup> Benefits to participants follow the prevailing wage rate, up to the maximum EI weekly benefit rate. Sponsors/employers are encouraged to provide a top-up to bridge any gap between the maximum benefit rate and the prevailing wage for the work being performed.</p>
<h4>Program delivery</h4>
<p>OJCP is delivered through the provision of funds to organizations that implement a community-benefiting project while providing work experience to participants. </p>
<p>The design and delivery of OJCP allows the Ontario to address a variety of barriers to employment experienced by its residents. OJCP can also be used to address labour market needs by targeting sub-groups of individuals, in-demand professions or economic sectors, and specific communities.</p>
<p>Program managers reported that the low level of funding allocated to OJCP is influenced by a lack of promotion of OJCP to organizations, previous unspent budget, the perceived lower value of OJCP, and by the funding of other LMDA programs being prioritized over OJCP.</p>
<p>In addition to gaining work experience, key informants identified a variety of other benefits that can be expected from OJCP projects. For example, participants are expected to develop work-related skills, enhance their job search abilities and improve their personal well-being. </p>
<p>Project holders can benefit from OJCP by increasing their organizational capacity, implementing their projects and expanding their portfolio of services provided. At the community level, projects can support the local economy and provide new assets (such as, restored buildings and development of hiking trails). </p>
<h4>Challenges and lessons learned</h4>
<p>Key informants identify challenges related to:</p>
<ul>
<li>recruitment of participants and organizations</li>
<li>ensuring that OJCP projects are assisting participants in addressing their barriers to employment</li>
<li>program administration and monitoring </li>
</ul>
<p>Key informants identify the following elements as contributing factors to participants' success: </p>
<ul>
<li>implementation is effective when Employment and Training Consultants provide support to project holders during the writing of their OJCP proposal and throughout project implementation </li>
<li>on-site visits, open communication, and establishing clear project expectations support effective monitoring</li>
<li>participants who benefit the most from OJCP are those in need of work experience, networking opportunities, or skills training</li>
<li>organizations with capacity and experience implementing OJCP projects are found to implement effective projects </li>
<li>projects found to be best suited under OJCP are those that provide tangible skills to participants or are community-based</li>
<ul>
<li>examples of well-suited projects include administration and research, marketing and design, construction or trail making, event coordination, and museum or archiving</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<h4>Key consideration for OJCP program and policy development</h4>
<p>The following consideration emerge as part of the OJCP study.</p>
<p>The program could benefit from increased promotion or changes to the benefit structure in order to attract more job seekers. </p>
<p>Participant recruitment was reported to be a challenge by key informants, despite positive outcomes of the program. Key informants reported that recruitment was hindered by the lack of promotion to job seekers, the difficulty of finding EI eligible clients and the low level of financial support available to participants.</p>
<h3 id="2.5.2">Labour Market Partnerships<sup id="fn49-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn49"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>49</a></sup></h3>
<p>Ontario designed 6 LMP programs that collectively aim to assist employers, communities and industries to address their labour force adjustments and human resource needs. They include a range of funded activities, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>labour market and human resource research </li>
<li>raising awareness about labour market and human resources information and best practices </li>
<li>employment services and workforce development planning activities (through engagement sessions, interpretation of labour market data and workforce strategies/plans development)</li>
<li>employment and training service coordination for employers (through consultations with stakeholders and strategies/plans development)</li>
<li>employer-led skills development training</li>
<li>labour force adjustment services (for example, pre-layoff supports, and needs assessment of laid-off workers)</li>
<li>activities to improve the quality and quantity of experiential learning opportunities available to undergraduate and graduate students</li>
</ul>
<p>Labour Market Partnerships is 1 type of support measures delivered under the LMDAs. In 2020 to 2021, Ontario spent nearly $85 million (including administrative costs) on Labour Market Partnerships, which represented 11% of the Canada-Ontario LMDA funding envelope. </p>
<h4>Funded organizations</h4>
<p>Funded organizations include:</p>
<ul>
<li>not-for-profit organizations</li>
<li>workforce development board</li>
<li>workforce adjustment centres</li>
<li>post-secondary education institutions</li>
<li>education councils</li>
<li>First Nation community owned business</li>
</ul>
<h4>Targeted labour market issues</h4>
<p>Funded projects target current and/or forecasted skills and/or labour shortages. These projects also target unemployment in specific subpopulations such as women, youth, Indigenous peoples, newcomers, persons with disabilities, the self-employed, and those who will soon be laid-off. </p>
<p>Generally, funded projects target labour market issues associated with:</p>
<ul>
<li>lack of capacity for human resource planning resulting in employee attraction and retention challenges </li>
<li>businesses downsizing/closure/layoffs </li>
<li>labour market information </li>
<li>skills development challenges and training gaps to fill in-demand jobs </li>
<li>demographical changes </li>
<li>technology changes </li>
<li>limited employment opportunities in Indigenous communities, and in small and remote communities</li>
</ul>
<p>All projects reviewed were aligned with program objectives and eligible activities. </p>
<h4>Partnerships</h4>
<p>Ontario ministries and program officials confirmed that regional/local program officials carried out activities to support the formation and maintenance of partnerships (with sector and community stakeholders) as a part of the LMP programs design and delivery. </p>
<p>Key informants explained that partners' expertise, network and financial contribution are all essential or beneficial to project implementation and success. </p>
<p>The document review of 17 projects confirmed that:</p>
<ul>
<li>partnerships were established to support the delivery of the majority of LMP projects</li>
<li>partners made a financial or in-kind contribution</li>
<ul>
<li>the most common forms of in-kind contribution were expertise, as well as staff time to support project delivery, office/event space and usage of equipment  </li>
</ul>
</ul>
<h4>Challenges and lessons learned </h4>
<p>Ontario ministries and key informants identified challenges related to:</p>
<ul>
<li>project holder recruitment and setting up LMP projects (lack of flexibility in the program's eligibility criteria, difficulties with recruiting knowledgeable project staff or consultants) </li>
<li>project delivery (engagement of partners and stakeholders, limited local employment and training service delivery capacity) </li>
<li>program administration and monitoring (shortage of funding available, short project duration) </li>
</ul>
<p>Actions of program officials and project characteristics that are conducive to the success of the program included:</p>
<ul>
<li>program officials working with prospective project holders to improve and finalise project proposals</li>
<li>ongoing communication and relationship building between Ontario program officials and project holders</li>
<li>clearly defined labour market issues/needs that the projects aim to address</li>
<ul>
<li>these generally occur through clear project objectives, activities, expected outputs and outcomes </li>
</ul>
<li>ensuring that project holders have the capacity to deliver the project</li>
<li>ensuring the selection of appropriate partners and the diversity of their perspectives and expertise</li>
</ul>
<h4>Key considerations for program and policy development</h4>
<ul>
<li>Considering that the current performance indicators do not reflect the diversity of activities funded under LMP, it is important for ESDC and Ontario to discuss current funded activities in order to make recommendations on how best to report on results</li>
<li>It is essential to share lessons learned about successful LMP projects:</li>
<ul>
<li>particularly, for projects targeted to employers (such as workplace or employer-sponsored training), and those assisting communities and economic sectors dealing with labour market adjustment issues (contraction or expansion)</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<h3 id="2.5.3">Research and Innovation<sup id="fn50-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn50"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>50</a></sup></h3>
<p>In Ontario, Research and Innovation is used to enable innovation in the employment and training system and to explore new ways of providing employment and training supports to employers, workers, and job seekers, including those who are not currently supported by other LMDA funded programs and services.  </p>
<p>Between 2014 and 2020, the annual budget allocated to Research and Innovation in Ontario has varied from 3% to 17%. Program officials report that the amount allocated to Research and Innovation is not fixed and is influenced by the province's workforce development priorities and the need to complement existing services.</p>
<h4>Funded organizations</h4>
<p>Funded organizations include:</p>
<ul>
<li>not-for-profit organizations (such as research organizations, school boards, and Indigenous organizations)</li>
<li>businesses/employers</li>
<li>educational institutions and training providers</li>
</ul>
<h4>Funded Research and Innovation activities</h4>
<p>Research and Innovation projects encompassed a variety of activities including:</p>
<ul>
<li>developing new tools and approaches to meet the labour market needs of employers and job seekers </li>
<li>supporting labour force development projects in remote Indigenous communities </li>
<li>supporting employer-driven training </li>
<li>pilot projects implementing and assessing new training and skills development approaches </li>
<li>academic research on labour market outcomes </li>
</ul>
<h4>Innovation definition and criteria</h4>
<p>Approaches or practices are considered innovative if they are:</p>
<ul>
<li>proposing new ways of operating</li>
<li>targeting new client groups</li>
<li>supporting new priorities or plans</li>
<li>promoting change </li>
</ul>
<p>Innovation can come in response to external forces, including labour market shocks, or as a result of internal review and/ or changing priorities. Most often, programs that are assessed to be innovative are pilot projects or are time-limited. </p>
<h4>Dissemination and adoption of innovative approaches</h4>
<p>Ontario requires some funded projects to disseminate their findings, lessons learned and results. These can be disseminated across provincial ministries, to service provider networks, and to the broader public. Dissemination activities can include, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>publishing reports</li>
<li>developing websites or adding content to existing websites</li>
<li>providing workshops and webinars</li>
</ul>
<h4>Performance measurement</h4>
<p>Research and Innovation project are subject to different performance measurement requirements. Most are required to submit interim and final reports on project outcomes. Some are also evaluated by the provincial government. </p>
<h4>Challenges and lessons learned </h4>
<p>Project documents and program officials identified challenges related to the testing and identification of innovative approaches including: </p>
<ul>
<li>recruiting employers to participate in the project</li>
<li>promoting the program and building relationships with employers</li>
<li>high rate of withdrawal by jobseekers participating in the program</li>
<li>poor job security for staff</li>
<li>insufficient coordination between post-secondary programs and workforce development programs</li>
</ul>
<p>In relation to factors contributing to successful testing and identification of innovative approaches, program officials highlighted the need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>tailor approaches to particular sectors</li>
<li>develop strategic partnerships between organizations in different sectors, including workforce development service providers, post-secondary institutions, and employers</li>
</ul>

<p>The objective of the program is to help apprentices become skilled tradespeople and to increase their labour market attachment. Program participants have generally chosen a career and are already attached to the labour market. The apprenticeship process involves on-the-job learning and technical training in a classroom setting. </p>
<p>Apprentices who have worked enough hours to qualify for EI can apply to receive EI Part I benefits while on training. The program provides financial assistance to EI eligible apprentices to help them offset the costs they incur while they attend technical training. The level of funding is based on the needs of apprentices, the location of the training, and any fees paid by the apprentices.<sup id="fn52-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn52"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>52</a></sup></p>
<p>The profile of program participants is presented in Table 21 by gender, age, sociodemographic group, and marital status. Information about their educational attainment, occupation and industry is based on the last job they held prior to applying for EI Part 1 benefits. Information about sociodemographic groups is self-reported.</p>

<h2 id="h2.6">Conclusions and recommendations</h2>
<p>The LMDAs are the largest annual investment in active labour market programs and services in Canada. Based on the findings presented in this report, the EBSMs are meeting the objective of assisting individuals to obtain or keep employment through various active employment programs, including training or employment assistance services.</p>
<h3 id="2.6.1">Summary of findings</h3>
<p>Overall, incremental impacts demonstrate that participation in most EBSMs improves labour market attachment and reduces dependence on government income support compared to similar non-participants. A subgroup analyses shows that, with some exceptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>SD and EAS improved the labour market attachment and reduced the dependence on income support for most subgroups of active EI claimant participants </li>
<li>JPI improved the labour market attachment and reduced the dependence on income support for female, male, and youth former claimant participants</li>
<li>OJCP improved the labour market attachment and reduced the dependence on income support for female active claimant participants but had mixed results for former claimants</li>
</ul>
<p>Over time, the social benefits of participating in JPI exceeded the initial investment costs for both active and former EI claimant participants. However, by the end of the post-program period,<sup id="fn54-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn54"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>54</a></sup> the costs were found to exceed the benefits for active EI claimant participants in SD, OJCP, and EAS, and for former claimants in OJCP.</p>
<p>A series of supplemental studies address information gaps previously identified in LMDA evaluations for Ontario Job Creation Partnerships, Labour Market Partnerships, Research and Innovation, and SD-Apprentices. Each study identified lessons learned, best practices and challenges. When relevant, studies included considerations for policy design and development. Overall, it was found that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ontario uses Ontario Job Creation Partnerships to:</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>address a variety of barriers to employment experienced by their residents (such as, a lack of work experience)</li>
<li>address the various labour market needs communities, subgroups of individuals, professions and economic sectors</li>
</ul>
<li>it is difficult to quantify all the positive impacts of OJCP for individuals, employers and communities</li>
<li>Ontario uses Labour Market Partnerships programs to assist employers, communities and/or industries to address their labour force adjustment and human resource needs</li>
<li>the province uses the Research and Innovation support measure to enable innovation in the employment and training system and to explore new ways of providing employment and training supports to employers, workers, and job seekers, including those who are not currently supported by other LMDA funded programs and services  </li>
<li>after participating in SD, apprentices increase their employment earnings and decrease their dependence on government income support </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2.6.2">Recommendations</h3>
<p>Since 2012, 15 qualitative and quantitative studies addressed issues and questions related to EBSM design, delivery and effectiveness: </p>
<ul>
<li>the quantitative studies successfully assessed the effectiveness and efficiency of EBSMs by producing incremental impacts and cost-benefit analysis</li>
<li>the qualitative studies identified specific challenges, lessons learned and best practices associated with the design and delivery of EBSMs</li>
<ul>
<li>each study included key considerations for program and policy development or recommendations </li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>The recently completed evaluation of the Workforce Development Agreements complements the LMDA qualitative studies. This evaluation was also supported by literature reviews and provided unique insights into challenges and lessons learned to assist persons with disabilities, immigrants and those further removed from the labour market.</p>
<p>Most results from this evaluation stem from the conduct of advance causal analysis whereby impacts found could be attributed to a specific EBSM. These analyses are predicated on having access to high quality administrative records, thereby confirming the importance of the capacity to leverage and integrate relevant administrative data.</p>
<p>From these main findings, 2 key recommendations emerge:</p>
<h4>Recommendation #1</h4>
<p>Ontario is encouraged to share and discuss lessons learned, best practices and challenges associated with the design and delivery of programs and services. Discussions are encouraged with ESDC, at the bilateral or multilateral levels as well as with service delivery network if necessary.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation #2</strong></p>
<p>Ontario is encouraged to pursue efforts to maintain and strengthen data collection provisions in support of reporting, performance measurement and data-driven evaluations at the national and provincial levels. </p>
