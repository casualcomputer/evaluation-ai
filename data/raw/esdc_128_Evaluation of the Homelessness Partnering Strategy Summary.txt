Infographic: Homelessness Partnering Strategy (HPS) fiscal years 2014 to 2015 and 2015 to 2016
Description
The Homelessness Partnering Strategy is designed with  the aim of preventing and reducing homelessness by providing direct support and  funding to communities across Canada. As of 2014 to 15, the program shifted to a  Housing First approach that focuses on stable housing as a priority for those  experiencing chronic or episodic homelessness.
Key findings
The program contributed to preventing and reducing homelessness in  Canada:
The  program surpassed its target of placing 3,000 people in longer-term stable  housing with over 6,000 people being placed in stable housing in fiscal year 2015 to 2016.
Over  10,000 non-Housing First clients also received housing placements in fiscal year 2014 to 2015 and fiscal year 2015 to 2016.
Fully, 73%  of clients were placed in stable housing within 90 days, and 77% of those  continuing to receive services were in stable housing after 6 months in  fiscal year 2015 to 2016.
The program contributed towards increasing financial stability and  self-sufficiency of homeless clients in fiscal year 2014 to 2015 and fiscal year 2015 to 2016:
4,500  clients experienced an improvement in their employment status;
3,400  clients started a job training program; and
2,600  clients started an educational program.
Recommendations
Extend Housing First interventions to a greater  proportion of the homeless population;
Further promote the participation of diverse groups on  Community Advisory Boards; and
Reduce the burden on communities to gather the  necessary information to monitor and measure performance.
