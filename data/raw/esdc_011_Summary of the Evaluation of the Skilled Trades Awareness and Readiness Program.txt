About the program
Launched in 2018, the Program encourages Canadians, particularly those facing barriers, to explore and prepare for careers in the skilled trades
The Program targets equity-deserving groups, which include youth, women, Indigenous peoples, newcomers, persons with disabilities, and racialized communities
The Program invested $36M in grants and contributions to fund 13 projects between 2018 to 2019 and 2021 to 2022
About the evaluation
A formative evaluation
to assess the Program design, delivery, and early results
Scope
: 13 funded projects from fiscal year 2018 to 2019 and 2021 to 2022
Approach
: multiple lines of evidence, including documents and file review, interviews with funding recipients and program officials, and focus groups with project participants
Key findings
Project activities contributed to strengthening pre-apprenticeship across Canada. Types of activities in 2018 to 2019 and 2021 to 2022 included:
awareness activities:
69% of activities, 12,701 participants
skills training:
77% of activities, 3,072 participants
work experience
: 46% of activities, 488 participants
Almost all funding recipients were satisfied with the adequacy and timeliness of the funding they received.
Incomplete information was collected over time to track performance measurement due to the absence of data on some indicators.
The majority of participants reported that project activities helped prepare them to enter a skilled trade.
Recommendation
The Program performance measurement strategy should ensure the collection and reporting of relevant, accurate and coherent data and information, facilitated by the mandatory participation of funding recipients in the annual reporting process and data validation.
