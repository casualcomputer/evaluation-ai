Executive Summary
Program Context
Health Canada’s Workplace Hazardous  Products Program (WHPP) is responsible for administering the
Hazardous Products Act
(HPA), the
Hazardous Materials Information Review Act
(HMIRA), and their associated regulations. WHPP regulates Canadian industry,  defined as persons who, in the course of business, sell or import hazardous  products. WHPP requires them to communicate hazards associated with products by  providing supplier labels and safety data sheets via the standardized Workplace  Hazardous Materials Information System (WHMIS). Implementation of WHMIS relies  on a complex system of interactions between partners, including provinces and  territories, and other stakeholder groups, such as suppliers of workplace  hazardous products, employers, and workers. WHPP’s activities include  overseeing compliance and enforcement related to the HPA, issuing  classification decisions for chemical substances, and reviewing suppliers’ claims  for confidential business information (CBI). It also develops policies and  maintains the Acts and regulations.
Key  Findings
What worked well
Within a complex and interlocking multijurisdictional system such as WHMIS, engagement and coordination with various partners and stakeholders is essential. Most internal and external key informants view WHPP’s engagement with stakeholders as one of its strengths.
Strong    engagement with partners also helped WHPP increase the number of HPA    inspections conducted by provincial and territorial (P/T) inspectors since    2017, and by Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC) as the    occupational health and safety authority for federally regulated workplaces,    at no additional cost to the Program. This enhanced partnership contributed to the development of an inspection program that is now conducted on a    proactive basis, as opposed to the previous, reactive system where    inspections were only conducted following a complaint.
WHPP    successfully led the modernization of the HMIRA, which enabled them to    streamline the process for CBI claims review. This work allowed the Program    to make significant progress on addressing its CBI backlog and enabled WHPP    to take a calibrated risk approach to reviewing future CBI claims.
What are the challenges
Supplier    compliance with HPA requirements is low (e.g., compliance with SDS and label    requirements), and more could be done to inform and promote the safe use of hazardous    products in the workplace.
The    current level of compliance and enforcement activities does not appear to be    sufficient, given the rates of non-compliance observed. WHPP’s inspection    capacity remains limited, as it relies extensively on P/T capacity and ESDC.    While this arrangement is cost-effective, it presents challenges in terms of    capacity for inspection activities and consistency in implementation.    Compliance enforcement tools currently available also limit WHPP’s ability to    address compliance issues in a timely manner.
Consumer    chemical products excluded from the HPA were found to be a growing concern    for worker safety. In particular, the evaluation found that these products    are being increasingly used in the workplace, but without adequate hazard    information to allow workers to protect themselves from extended and repeated    use.
Additional    communication and engagement with suppliers on HPA requirements appear necessary,    considering the poor compliance results to date. Data identified that smaller    suppliers faced more barriers to awareness and understanding and that the    current level of engagement with smaller suppliers by WHPP is limited and    could be expanded.
There    is a lack of baseline data on workplace hazardous products needed to assess    Program impact.
Given WHPP’s limited capacity and resources, it will    not be in a position to address the challenges it faces, unless there are    fundamental changes.
Recommendations
Recommendation  #1: Consider means to increase compliance and enforcement activities, and  explore an expanded range of enforcement tools.
Many key informants view the increase in HPA inspections as a success.  However, this function’s success will remain limited in supporting supplier  compliance unless there are programmatic changes, such as additional  enforcement tools. The Program could benefit from seeking input from other programs  within Health Canada and from international partners on their compliance and  enforcement strategies with respect to hazardous products in the workplace.
Recommendation  #2: Enhance communication and guidance material on excluded products for all  WHPP stakeholders and partners.
HPA product exclusions, especially for consumer chemical products, is  an area of concern for many stakeholders, including inspectors, suppliers, and  organized labour. For example, risks associated with consumer chemical products  used in the workplace are not clearly communicated, and are thus misunderstood  by employers and employees, who can become at greater risk of occupational  exposure. In addition to enhancing communications on risks associated with these  products, WHPP may also want to explore how to best manage exclusions within  the legislation, such as exploring if they could be removed for some high-risk  products.
Recommendation  #3: Expand communication and engagement with suppliers, in particular with  small suppliers.
As suggested by the high rate of non-compliance, supplier awareness  and understanding of the HPA and
Hazardous  Products Regulations
(HPR) should be enhanced. While the Program has  developed a wide range of compliance promotion material, interview data suggests  that the full range of suppliers is not being reached, and that information is  not being understood. WHPP should continue its partnership with the Canadian  Centre for Occupational Health and Safety in developing guidance documents and  plain language material, and should consider implementing a targeted outreach  program for small suppliers.
Recommendation  #4: Explore means to improve  measurement of Program impact.
Data collection could strengthen measures of Program impact on  supplier compliance and downstream effects on overall worker safety. The  Program could benefit from exploring if its existing partnerships could be  leveraged to improve impact measurement.

What workplace  hazardous products are and how they are regulated
Hazardous products are found in most Canadian workplaces, and can range  from cleaning products and construction materials, to full-scale chemical  production. These products can present physical hazards, such as flammability, and  lead to health hazards, such as carcinogenicity and reproductive toxicity. If  hazardous products are not used, stored, and handled properly, they can cause  injury, death, illness, disease, fire, or explosions.
Footnote
1
A key element in protecting workers from workplace hazardous products is  to provide them with information that will identify the physical and health  hazards associated with these products, as well as the appropriate precautions  to take in order to work safely and avoid injury. As such, the
Hazardous Products Act
(HPA) requires  suppliers of hazardous products to communicate the hazards associated with  their products via product labels and Safety Data Sheets (SDSs) as a condition  of sale and importation for workplace use. The
Hazardous Products Regulations
(HPR) specify the criteria for  classifying hazards posed by chemical products and the requirements for product  labels and SDSs (see Appendix A for an example of a label and SDS elements).
Labels and SDSs are key elements of the Workplace Hazardous Materials  Information System (WHMIS), Canada's national hazard communication standard,  which was first created in 1988. WHMIS is implemented through coordinated  federal, provincial, and territorial (F/P/T) legislation.
Without WHMIS, employers would not have the necessary information to  protect workers from the physical and health hazards posed by these products.  As a result, workers could potentially be exposed to avoidable risks in the  workplace and rates of workplace injuries could increase.
Due to the absence of baseline data on workplace exposures, it is not  possible to specifically attribute workplace injuries and fatalities to  hazardous products under the HPA. However, data from the Association of  Workers’ Compensation Boards of Canada shows that exposure to harmful  substances or environments was still the leading cause of workplace fatalities  (64%), and the fourth most common reason for lost time claims (7%) in 2017.
Footnote
2
In addition, a 2019 report by the Occupational  Cancer Research Centre estimated that exposure to common occupational  carcinogens, such as ultraviolet radiation, asbestos, diesel engine exhaust,  and silica dust, is responsible for over 10,000 cancer cases in Canada each  year.
Footnote
3
Moreover, according to the Occupational Cancer Research Centre of Ontario,  thousands of cases of occupational disease, such as dermatitis and respiratory  conditions, occur annually in Ontario, but only a small percentage are  recognized as being related to workplace exposures.

Evaluation Scope and Approach
The evaluation had two objectives: the  first was to assess how the Program contributes to informing the safe use of  hazardous products in Canadian workplaces, and the second was to inform WHPP’s  senior management on sustainable potential Program improvements, with an  enhanced focus on compliance and enforcement activities.
The evaluation reviewed Program  activities from 2014-15 to 2018-19. This is the first evaluation of the Program’s  activities. More details on the evaluation methodology, and on data collection  methods and limitations, are included in Appendix B.
Program Structure
Health Canada (HC), through its Workplace Hazardous Products Program  (WHPP), administers the HPA and HPR, which set the WHMIS labelling and SDS  requirements for suppliers. WHPP  is also responsible for HC’s authorities under the
Hazardous Materials Information Review Act
(HMIRA) and the
Hazardous Materials Information Review Regulations
.
How  the Program works
WHPP  coordinates the administration and governance of WHMIS as an F/P/T partnership.  WHMIS also operates through interrelated pieces of F/P/T occupational health  and safety (OHS) legislation that cover hazardous products from manufacture to  use in a workplace.
While  WHPP regulates persons who, in the course of business, sell or import hazardous  products, while other F/P/T OHS jurisdictions regulate the workplace (i.e.,  employers and workers). The federal OHS jurisdiction regulating federal  workplaces is the Labour Program at Employment and Social Development Canada  (ESDC). They conduct HPA inspections of federal workplaces.
WHPP’s  objective is to help workers obtain the information they need to safely use,  handle, and store hazardous products, and take precautions to avoid injury,  illness, and premature death. It does this by regulating a national standard  for classifying and communicating hazards of workplace chemicals, including:
Overseeing  compliance and enforcement
of suppliers with the HPA and HPR. It is important to note that, in accordance  with a series of Memoranda of Understanding (MOU) established in the late 1980s  and early 1990s, P/T and ESDC OHS partners, on behalf of HC, conduct inspection  activities related to the HPA and HPR, without transfer of funds.
Issuing  classification decisions
,  by conducting technical assessments of chemical substances and products against  hazard classification criteria.
Reviewing  Confidential Business Information (CBI) claims,
filed under  the HMIRA, for  companies to suppress the disclosure of ingredients on their SDSs to protect  their trade secrets, while enabling workers to receive sufficient and accurate  information on product hazards.
Developing  general policy
on  communication of workplace chemical hazards and maintaining the Acts and  Regulations, as well as collaborating with international partners to advance  standards for worker safety.
Program partners
Roles and  responsibilities of key partners for this Program are as follows
Footnote
5
:
Suppliers
of  hazardous products to Canadian workplaces must comply with the HPA and the HPR.  Suppliers also participate in the consultative mechanisms established by WHPP.
P/T and ESDC OHS Authorities
are responsible for establishing and  implementing an inspection regime for the HPA in their jurisdiction. OHS authorities  begin proceedings on contraventions of the HPA or HPR for hazardous products  originating in, or imported into, their jurisdiction. They also set out the requirements and  obligations for employers regarding workplaces and the training of workers.
Employers
are responsible for implementing the health and safety  requirements established by P/T and ESDC OHS authorities. When creating new  products that contain hazardous ingredients for use in their own workplaces,  employers must also comply with the information requirements set out in the F/P/T  OHS regulations. Employer representatives also participate in the consultative  mechanisms established by WHPP.
Workers
participate in the consultative mechanisms established  by WHPP through representatives from organized labour groups.
Canadian Centre for  Occupational Health and Safety (CCOHS)
is the primary national  agency in Canada for the advancement of safe and healthy workplaces, and  preventing work-related injuries, illnesses and deaths. Through an Interdepartmental  Letter of Agreement, WHPP engages CCOHS to support its work. CCOHS work has  included developing and disseminating WHMIS information products, webinars, and  online courses. CCOHS also hosts a single window (WHMIS.org) for links to  information on all WHMIS requirements.
United States (US)  Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)
has a Regulatory Partnership Statement  and an MOU with HC. Through these documents, HC and OSHA have committed to  aligning and synchronizing their implementation of the Globally Harmonized  System (GHS), where appropriate, in order to minimize the impact of, and  prevent, future regulatory differences or variances.
United Nations Subcommittee of Experts on the Globally Harmonized System
is  the forum through which Canada participates in the development of the GHS and  helps to shape hazard classifications and criteria, as well as future hazard  communication requirements.
Program history  and current context
Program history  and current context - Text description
This image represent  the Program history and current context, the years in a bubble attach to a box  of text:
1981
: F/P/T OHS authorities made a request to the Canadian Association of  Administrators of Labour Legislation (CAALL) for a federal role in regulating  the sale and import of hazardous products in Canadian workplaces. The purpose  of this regulatory role was to establish a nationally consistent approach for  hazard classification and communication standards.
1988
: WHMIS was  implemented through the adoption of the HMIRA, the HPA, and their associated  regulations. Within this new legislative and regulatory framework, the newly  created independent Hazardous Materials Information Review Commission (HMIRC)  was responsible for the review of CBI claims filed under the HMIRA, while the  administration of the HPA fell under the responsibility of Consumer and  Corporate Affairs Canada (CCAC). The latter responsibility was later  transferred to HC’s National Office of WHMIS in 1993.
1989-1991
: HC and  F/P/T partners signed a series of MOUs. These MOUs formalized an agreement  whereby P/T and ESDC OHS inspectors would conduct HPA inspections within their  regions on behalf of the federal regulator.
2008: The budget of  HC’s National Office of WHMIS was eliminated following a strategic review.  However, the function and staff remained, creating financial pressure on the  Directorate who had to reassign funds internally.
2013
: The  independent HMIRC ceased to exist and its responsibilities in reviewing CBI  claims were transferred to HC, including its employees and budget, and  amalgamated with the responsibilities of the National Office of WHMIS. This  amalgamation created the Workplace Hazardous Products Program (WHPP).
2015
: HC amended the  HPA to implement the United Nations Globally Harmonized System of  Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (GHS). In doing so, WHPP repealed the  Controlled Products Regulations and introduced the Hazardous Products  Regulations (HPR). Under the HPR, suppliers of hazardous products had to  disclose the exact concentration of product ingredients, rather than the  previous practice of using concentration ranges. This change resulted in a  dramatic increase in CBI claims requests, which created a backlog.
2018-19
: WHPP  amended the HPR to reinstate the use of concentration ranges when disclosing  product ingredients, reducing the need for suppliers to file CBI claims. HMIRA  amendments enabled WHPP to implement a risk-based approach to reviewing future  CBI claims.
Evaluation Findings
Achievement of Results
Although WHPP has successfully managed and  implemented many of its priorities over the last five years, its overall impact  on informing the safe use of hazardous products through supplier compliance  with HPA and HPR requirements was limited.
While recent changes within WHPP are expected to  further support achievement of results, there is a need for more compliance and  enforcement activities.
Informing  the safe use of hazardous products
Ultimately, the purpose of WHPP is to  facilitate consistent and effective communication on hazardous products in  Canadian workplaces. Since occupational health and safety (OHS) is a federal, provincial,  and territorial (F/P/T) responsibility, WHPP contributes to worker protection  by facilitating international and domestic hazard classification and consistent  communications, so employers have the information they need to help protect  workers from hazards and fulfill their legal responsibilities.
Low Supplier Compliance
In 2017-18, WHPP conducted an internal audit of SDSs to assess their  compliance with the HPA and HPR. The audit assessed whether the SDSs included  all the necessary information for employers and employees on proper use, storage, and handling of the product, its risks, how to protect  oneself from acute and chronic exposure, and first aid instructions in case of  exposure.
The audit examined 188 SDSs produced by suppliers and found that  certain components in all of the SDSs reviewed (100%) were non-compliant with  HPA or HPR requirements. Overall, close to 4,967 observations of non-compliance  were found; this comes to an average of 26.4 observations per SDS. The lowest  number of non-compliance observations per SDS was two, and the highest number  of non-compliance observations was 70. Of particular concern, the audit found a  96.3% non-compliance rate in Section 2 (Hazard Identification) of SDSs, which  is the section that informs workers of the appropriate protective measures to  take when using, storing, handling, or disposing of hazardous products.  Non-compliance observations for Section 2 included missing hazard statements  and precautionary statements.
The SDS audit results showed non-compliance across all levels of  hazard classification complexity, which included classifications of simple,  medium, and complex. They also showed non-compliance across all suppliers,  regardless of their region and size.
Data collected on suppliers’ compliance, as  part of HPA inspection activities, is limited. P/T and ESDC OHS inspectors conduct  HPA inspections on behalf of the federal regulator, in accordance with various MOUs  established in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Prior to 2017, HPA inspections  were only conducted if a complaint was received; hence, only a handful were  done over the past 29 years. Inspection activities have increased in number  since 2017, with the implementation of a more proactive inspection protocol  that was not accompanied by a transfer of funds. Thus, 101 inspections were  conducted in 2017-18, 148 were planned for 2018-19, and a target of 138  inspections was set for 2019-20. The number of inspections conducted in 2018-19  was not available at the time this report was produced. The target number of  inspections is based on the number of designated inspectors, which fluctuates  from year to year.
While inspection activities have increased,  the production of inspection reports is dependent on P/T and ESDC OHS partners,  who are already managing their own workloads and dealing with other conflicting  priorities. Within this context, WHPP has only partially received inspection  results. To date, only 43 reports on results have been received for 2017-18,  even though 101 inspections were conducted. As OHS inspectors are still  submitting their HPA inspection reports for 2017-18 and 2018-19, WHPP did not  complete a roll-up of inspection data in time for this evaluation. Still, as  inspection results become available, WHPP intends to produce a roll-up of data.
While WHPP has strong data on supplier  compliance through the audit that was conducted, this data remains limited as  it only represents a small portion of hazardous products used in Canadian  workplaces. The Program is lacking key data on hazardous products (e.g., a  complete list of suppliers), which limits its ability to fully measure overall  compliance with the HPA and HPR.
Contributing Factors  to Non-Compliance
Awareness  and understanding of requirements
As indicated in the SDS audit report, low supplier compliance can be  indicative of low awareness and understanding of the HPA and HPR requirements. As  such, one of the audit recommendations was to provide resources that clearly  articulate these requirements for suppliers. Options for consideration included  developing focused communications and guidance material on specific sections of  the SDS that are often incorrect, and targeted outreach to vendors who develop  SDS templates, as well as supplier associations and hazard communications  organizations.
Footnote
6
While many HPA inspectors and WHMIS  coordinators expressed appreciation for the existing guidance documents on HPA and  HPR requirements for suppliers, some also noted challenges with them. Examples  of challenges include limited reach and use of guidance material, and apparent  inconsistencies in how suppliers understand and interpret requirements.
For example, the Compliance Promotion Package  created by WHPP for suppliers undergoing an inspection appeared to be underused.  While the package contains key information on HPA and HPR requirements and  non-compliance, evidence from several interviews with WHIMS coordinators and  inspectors suggested that suppliers often do not use it or understand it well.  As such, only 17% of inspectors surveyed agreed that suppliers understood the  pre-inspection information that was provided to them (i.e., the Compliance  Promotion Package). A few noted that suppliers often do not read the material  sent to them.
Still, some external key informants noted that  WHPP, through its partnership with the Canadian Centre for Occupational Health  and Safety (CCOHS), could further contribute to increasing the availability of  plain language information related to HPA and HPR requirements. For its part,  CCOHS produces educational and awareness tools and training for all  stakeholders involved in WHMIS. Most P/T and ESDC OHS representatives  interviewed noted that WHMIS stakeholders, including themselves, tend to turn  to CCOHS and WHMIS.org as sources of plain-language information.
Compliance  more challenging for small suppliers
Many internal and external key informants see  small suppliers as facing more barriers to understanding and compliance with  the HPA and HPR requirements, due in part to their limited capacity and  resources. While this was raised as an area of concern, the proportion of small  suppliers dealing with hazardous products is relatively unknown, thus creating  uncertainty around the extent of the issue. Still, data from Industry Canada  identified  that, as of December 2017, small businesses represented 97.9% of all Canadian  business.
Footnote
7
As suggested by a few internal and external key informants and survey  respondents, one assumption may be that smaller suppliers rely on their own  suppliers' hazard information to develop their product labels and SDSs. If the  original information is inaccurate, this can trigger a non-compliance cascade  down the supply chain.
Several internal and external key informants  pointed out the importance for WHPP to better understand and adapt its  communication materials and guidance documents to the information needs of  small suppliers. Reviewed documents showed that, in an effort to better engage  small suppliers, WHPP has contacted small business representatives, but there  has been minimal uptake from these groups.
Limited  enforcement tools
Over the last five years, WHPP has taken a  gradual approach to its compliance activities by aiming to facilitate voluntary  compliance before moving to enforcement. While some consider this approach more  efficient and effective, as it avoids the need to move to enforcement, reviewed  documents indicate that jurisdictions have experienced challenges in getting  timely voluntary compliance from suppliers. In fact, interviews with most internal  and external key informants, as well as survey results, suggest that suppliers  are not always proactive in, or motivated to, achieve compliance.
Several internal and external key informants  also noted that the current system lacks enforcement tools for when voluntary  compliance is not achieved. More specifically, the only enforcement tools  available are ministerial orders, which are viewed as heavy-handed and thus  rarely used. A few external key informants expressed a need to see an increased  range of enforcement actions, in the hopes that it would give more leverage for  HPA inspectors to bring suppliers into compliance. Alternative enforcement  actions suggested by some internal and external key informants included  introducing mid-range enforcement tools.  Examples provided  were recalls, import bans, and conditions that have a financial impact on  non-compliant suppliers, among others.
WHPP  actions to support compliance
To support  supplier compliance and facilitate the conduct of HPA inspections by P/T and  ESDC OHS authorities, WHPP has been working over the last five years on various  tools and initiatives:
Proactive  publication of hazardous products classification decisions
: As a first step to addressing improper  classifications, WHPP is currently working on publishing Hazardous Substance  Assessments (HSA) online as a tool for suppliers and employers to use as the  basis of the classification of their products. Publication of classification  decisions will focus first on high-risk products that are also highly used.
Introduction  of Focused Inspections
:  Focused Inspections have been introduced in support of P/T and ESDC OHS authorities  conducting HPA inspections. Focused Inspections assess the compliance of a  supplier or workplace, as it relates to a specific area of interest or concern.  The precise scope is determined with P/T and ESDC OHS partners to allow them to  align resources.
Implementation  of the Inspection Rating System
: To support the reporting of inspection results and increase national  consistency of compliance and enforcement actions, WHPP has developed an  Inspection Rating System in collaboration with its partners. This System  combines principles of risk analysis and management, and is used to categorize instances  of non-compliance based on risk. This tool was first implemented in April 2019.
Implementation  of FileMaker:
In  2019-20, to further support their P/T and ESDC OHS partners in the production  of inspection reports, WHPP worked on the implementation of FileMaker, an online reporting system for HPA inspectors that  is expected to streamline the process for recording non-compliances observed  from inspections.
“There are  several categories of substances that we know meet the definition of ‘hazardous’, but they are excluded from the HPA, and those exclusions really limit the effectiveness of both Health Canada and P/T regulators.”
External key informant
It  should be noted that all of these tools and initiatives are either in the late  stages of development, or early phases of implementation. Accordingly, there  are no documented results on their success.
Other barriers to informing the  safe use of hazardous products
Supplier  compliance is not the only element related to the HPA and HPR that affects the  safe use of hazardous products in the workplace. Several external and internal  key informants expressed concerns over products that are excluded from the HPA,  and for which information on chronic exposure risks is limited.
According  to the HPA, several product categories are excluded from the WHMIS 2015  legislation. These product categories include, but are not limited to,  explosives, cosmetics, pest control products, consumer chemical products, and  manufactured products.
Footnote
8
Labelling requirements for many of these  products are covered under other laws and can be very different and less  comprehensive than WHMIS compliant labelling, particularly for consumer  chemical products.
Consumer  products containing chemicals are reasonably expected to be obtained by individuals  for non-commercial purposes, including domestic and recreational use. These  products fall under the
Canada Consumer  Product Safety Act,
and are excluded under the HPA. Labelling requirements are  based on their non-commercial use and thus communicate hazards based on minimal  use of the product, focusing more on acute risks.
In  contrast, hazardous products covered by WHMIS are accompanied by a label and a  SDS that communicate risks associated with both acute and chronic exposure to  the product. They also indicate ways in which employees can protect themselves  from the harms of single and repeated exposure to the product. The SDS also  offers employers and workers information on hazard identification, ingredient  composition, toxicological information, first aid measures, and more. Appendix C  illustrates the difference between a consumer chemical product label and a  WHMIS label for the same product.
Thus, if an employer purchases a hazardous  product from a retail store instead of buying industrial grade products from a  supplier, information on its safe use can vary largely as it is governed by  different legislation. This may leave employers and employees unaware of risks  that can be associated with repeated exposure to some products, such as  carcinogenicity, reproductive toxicity, and lung or skin sensitization. This is  seen by many stakeholders as a growing concern, particularly for certain sectors,  like janitorial services, and nail and beauty salons, which are known to use  excluded consumer chemical products on a daily basis, including hair dye, nail  polish and polish remover, cleaners, and more. It is also seen as a concern for  employers with limited access to industrial grade products, such as employers  in remote and northern regions.
Most external key informants, including P/T  and ESDC OHS partners, reported that the different labelling systems used for  WHMIS and for consumer chemical products has created challenges for ensuring  that workers are informed of risks when dangerous consumer chemical products  are used in the workplace. In response to this challenge, some external key  informants even asked for the removal of some of the HPA exclusions.
Work  done by WHPP to address the challenge
WHPP is  currently working with a contracted specialist to explore the impact on the  health and safety of workers related to the use of consumer chemical products  in the workplace. While this research is underway, the Program is developing a communication  and outreach campaign to raise employer and worker awareness of the risks  associated with the use of consumer chemical products in the workplace, in  collaboration with CCOHS.
Efficiency
Engagement and coordination with partners and other  stakeholder groups is essential to program efficiency within an interlocking  jurisdictional system such as WHMIS. Many key informants view WHPP’s engagement  with partners and stakeholders as a key strength.
In its effort  to improve efficiency, WHPP could learn from the ways other international  jurisdictions deal with similar compliance and enforcement challenges.
What worked  well and what can be improved
Efficiency through engagement  and collaboration
Implementation  of WHMIS relies on a complex system of interactions between partners, including  provinces and territories, and stakeholder groups, such as suppliers of  workplace chemicals, employers, and workers. WHPP understands that successful engagement  with these partners and stakeholders enhances the impact and effectiveness of its  actions, through a combined and more efficient use of resources.
To  facilitate engagement and coordination among partners and stakeholder groups,  WHPP has established two formal committees: the Current Issues Committee (CIC)  and the Intergovernmental WHMIS Coordinating Committee (IWCC).
Footnote

,
Footnote
10
Reviewed committee  documents identify that WHPP has been successful at establishing relationships  with a strong commitment to Program success from each partner and stakeholder.
Current Issues Committee
Purpose
: The CIC serves as the forum for consultation and advice on  matters related to interpretation or modification of the HPA, and  facilitates information and knowledge exchange between WHPP and  stakeholders affected by the HPA.
Membership
: WHPP, Organized Labour    Associations, Supplier Associations, Employer Associations, CCOHS, and  CAALL.
The CIC was  seen by all parties involved as a valuable forum to reach external stakeholders  and promote improved awareness of federal requirements. In particular, all key  informants who participate in the CIC described the committee positively,  stating that it helps promote awareness of HPA and HPR requirements by working  with representatives of suppliers, employers, and workers across Canada.
The CIC was  seen as a successful forum, yet some key informants still identified  opportunities for improvement. More specifically, they saw opportunities to  expand engagement with underrepresented groups, such as small and medium  enterprises, regional and northern industry associations, employers and  retailers, representatives for Indigenous peoples across Canada, and  sector-specific associations.
Some key  informants also indicated that, considering the occasionally differing views of  members, such as industry and labour associations, the CIC could be slow in  reaching consensus on advice for HC. To avoid delays in CIC’s work,  WHPP has implemented bilateral engagements with stakeholder groups. All those  involved see such engagements as useful in ensuring that diverse stakeholder  needs are heard.
Inter-governmental WHMIS Coordinating Committee
Purpose:
The IWCC supports intergovernmental cooperation on compliance, enforcement, and implementation of policies, legislation and regulations enhancing worker protection through hazard communication. IWCC provides a forum for  F/P/T representatives to exchange ideas and information related to the HPA and HPR.
Membership:
WHPP,Provincial and Territorial Health and Safety representatives, Federal Labour Program ESDC representatives, and CAALL.
HPA  inspection activities rely on P/T and ESDC OHS authorities to conduct  inspections on behalf of HC, through a series of MOUs. The IWCC helps support  the values of inter-governmental cooperation enshrined in these agreements by  providing an opportunity to share good practices and challenges across  jurisdictional lines.
Interviewed P/T  and ESDC OHS coordinators unanimously expressed appreciation for the IWCC  forum. They noted that the committee provided an excellent opportunity to  develop personal relationships with coordinators in other regions, and to  understand the context in which their partners were working.
It was noted by  several key informants that IWCC relationships also improved work-related  transactions. For example, when inspectors identify non-compliant hazard  communication information on a product, where the supplier is located in  another jurisdiction or in more than one jurisdiction in Canada, collaboration  between WHMIS coordinators in the implicated regions is required to plan the  appropriate follow-up actions.
Footnote
11
WHMIS coordinators are P/T and ESDC OHS representatives that coordinate HPA  inspections within their respective jurisdiction and sit on the IWCC.
According to some IWCC participants, the  relationships that coordinators have built through the committee and its  working groups help facilitate the process of inter-jurisdictional referrals  and timely evidence sharing across various jurisdictions. All WHMIS coordinators  interviewed for the evaluation indicated that the relationships they had built through  the IWCC were helpful in developing an understanding of the workload and  capacity of provincial partners involved in inter-jurisdictional files. As a  result, the sending and receiving provinces were able to develop a shared  understanding of reasonable timelines to complete such files, particularly  between provinces with many suppliers, and provinces with very few suppliers.  Furthermore, the IWCC and its working groups have enabled the sharing of  resources and tools to facilitate the compliance verification process between  jurisdictions.
Example of information sharing:
Silica in      non-silica sandblasting products
The Alberta OHS inspectors used the IWCC to inform      other jurisdictions about silica-related risks, as silica can cause serious      or fatal respiratory disease. The inspectors shared the results of a study      conducted in Alberta that found that a non-silica product recommended by      their own authority as a substitute to sandblasting products containing      silica, actually contained a percentage of silica that was still hazardous      to workers. This information was sometimes not accurately disclosed on the      SDS for the product. One key informant indicated that some jurisdictions      would not have found out about this risk so promptly without the IWCC.
Opportunity  to enhance exchanges between committees
While  these two committees share different roles and purposes, many external key  informants that sit on these committees expressed a desire to know more about  each other’s work. Some external key informants asked if there could be  opportunities for WHPP to enhance communication and information sharing between  these committees in order to satisfy participants’ information needs.
Alignment with International  Partners
As  supply chains for hazardous products become increasingly globalized, many  products used in Canadian workplaces come from international suppliers.
Footnote
12
The United Nations introduced  the GHS with the goal of aligning international regulations for classification  and communication of hazards associated with chemicals in each country.
Footnote
13
Canada is up-to-date with  the fifth revision of the GHS, and will be implementing the seventh revision in  tandem with the US, although the specific date has not been confirmed. It  should be noted that, as WHPP was preparing to implement the sixth revision,  the seventh revision was issued. Within this context, there was a decision to  align implementation with the seventh revision instead of the sixth.
The  GHS is not prescriptive, but rather based on a “building block” approach.  Participating countries determine which elements of communication for physical,  health, and environmental hazards they will implement, and to which sectors  these will apply within their country.
Footnote
14
As such, there is a level  of variation between Canada’s GHS regulations and those in other countries. One  internal key informant described alignment as a balance between ensuring that  hazard communications are predictable and standardized, while also ensuring  that domestic regulations meet the unique needs for worker safety in Canada. One  example of this is the requirement under Canada’s
Official  Languages Act
that SDSs and labels be bilingual.
With  the US being Canada’s largest trading partner, WHPP aims to align Canadian  requirements with those of the US to the greatest extent possible. A MOU with  the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), signed in 2013 and  renewed in 2018, formalized this relationship. Implementation of the MOU is  supported by the Canada-US Regulatory Cooperation Council, a bilateral  committee that works on shared initiatives related to guidance development,  international engagement, and regulatory alignment.
A few internal  and external key informants noted that many suppliers and employers believe  that a US SDS is automatically compliant in Canada, when in fact it is not.  WHPP has recently developed joint guidance with the US to address this issue.
Footnote
15
WHPP has made an effort  to communicate the differences between Canadian and American requirements by  publishing a description of some key variances between the US and Canadian regulations  in an online guidance document
Footnote
16
and in the HPR  technical guidance.
Footnote
17
Still some key informants noted that there is an opportunity to improve in this  area, for example, through the publication of a complete list of differences  between the US and Canada.
Canada  is an active participant in international forums, and co-chairs a United  Nations subcommittee to  assess the possibility of the development of a global list of chemicals  classified in accordance with the GHS.
How  WHPP compares
A  comparative analysis was done to see how Canada’s hazard communication system  compares to those of other international jurisdictions, with a particular focus  on compliance and enforcement of suppliers with required labelling and SDSs. The  comparative analysis focused on three jurisdictions where systems aligned with  the GHS and operated within a similar context: the US, the European Union (EU),  with a specific focus on the United Kingdom (UK), and Australia. Appendix D  provides additional information on these models, including details on key best  practices adopted by each.
Data  from the comparative analysis showed Canada to be distinct in the way it manages  proprietary information (i.e., CBI claims) of products, and in the  multi-jurisdictional nature of its system for administering hazard  communications, as well as its system compliance and enforcement.
Proprietary information on products
The EU, through the European Chemicals  Agency, has a requirement similar to Canada’s for disclosure of the presence of  a trade secret, and charges a fee in accordance with the regulations to process  the claim. The EU system registers the information related to CBI claims in a  central database accessible to consumers and professionals, enabling them to  find hazard information. The European regulations cover both workplace  hazardous products and consumer products.
Footnote
18
Conversely,  in the US, there is no requirement to submit a CBI claim to OSHA and no fees  are charged. The only requirement is if a product contains a trade secret  hazardous ingredient, the SDS must indicate this.
In  light of the differences described above, a few key informants described Canada  as a middle ground between the US and EU, while some suggested that the EU  offers more protection to workers. Until the amendments to the HMIRA come into  force, the requirement for HC to guarantee the compliance of the full SDS or  label submitted with a CBI claim sets Canada apart from its international  counterparts who do not perform a compliance review.
System administration
All  of the reviewed jurisdictions appear to have taken an all-inclusive approach  that regulates not only the industry, but also employers. They all have one governing  body responsible for the overall administration of the system, including  administering legislation and regulations, coordinating compliance and  enforcement activities, and ensuring that companies (industries and employers)  are meeting their obligations with respect to worker education and training.
Compliance  and enforcement authorities in other jurisdictions oversee more than just  hazardous products, such as fall protection, vehicle hazards, heat, unsanitary  conditions, and noise. However, they still face challenges similar to the ones  encountered in Canada. For instance, Australia identified a need to improve  consistency in the application and enforcement of its laws across its jurisdictions,  while the UK faced challenges in inspection reporting from its local authorities.
Key Lessons from Other Jurisdictions
The comparative analysis also examined good  practices adopted by other jurisdictions, as the following demonstrates. It  should be noted that, while not every good practice may be applicable to the  Canadian context due to jurisdictional differences, they still offer insight on  approaches that could be explored to help increase supplier awareness and  compliance.
Key Lessons from Other Jurisdictions - Text description
List of Key Lessons from Other Jurisdictions
Compliance advice
Sharing success stories
Supporting consistency of approach  through guidance and committee work
Targeted information for business,  including small business
Various compliance tools for various  purposes
Compliance advice
In the US, OSHA has implemented a  cooperative program to support collaborative efforts between various  stakeholders. Compliance Promotion Specialists facilitate this by providing  information on the different compliance resources that are available, including  information on how to comply with OSHA standards.
Footnote
19
While  WHPP offers similar compliance advice during inspections, it could explore  other opportunities for this type of collaboration with suppliers.
Sharing  success stories
In  addition, OSHA also publishes success stories and case studies on their website  to highlight lessons learned and best practices. For instance, they have a  recognition program that highlights exemplary health and safety programs  implemented by small businesses, including the methods companies have  implemented to correct hazards, as well as business practices that have changed  to prevent injuries and illnesses.
Footnote
20
Public recognition may  encourage businesses to be more proactive in achieving compliance.
Supporting  consistency of approach through guidance and committee work
The  UK model is similar to Canada’s and relies on various local authorities to  conduct enforcement activities. Much like WHPP’s approach to supporting  consistency through guidance and committee work, the UK has also created the  Health and Safety Executive/Local Authority Enforcement Liaison Committee  (HELA) to support coordination efforts in compliance and enforcement.
Footnote
21
This committee is similar  to the IWCC created by WHPP to discuss compliance and enforcement activities  conducted by P/T and ESDC OHS partners.
Targeted information for businesses,  including small businesses
In  the UK, the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) supports a number of advisory  committees and industry groups, including the Strategy of the Small Business  Trade Association, a committee dedicated to raising awareness and facilitating  information sharing on common health and safety issues faced specifically by  small and medium businesses.
Footnote
22
In light of the concerns raised about small suppliers, targeted information  sharing through a dedicated advisory committee could be an interesting avenue  for WHPP to consider going forward.
The  comparative analysis also found that Australia faces similar challenges to  Canada with respect to small businesses. In fact, a recent review of Australian  workplace health and safety laws showed that small businesses are unclear on how  to assess hazards in their workplace, including what actions to take to fulfil  their obligations. Consequently, the review recommended that regulators focus  on helping small businesses interpret the regulations within the context of  their own workplaces.
Footnote
23
Various compliance tools for various  purposes
A literature  review undertaken by SafeWork Australia found that small and large businesses  could potentially benefit from different regulations. For large businesses, a  model that focuses on easy access to information and strict enforcement of  non-compliance may be more effective, whereas for small businesses, a more  appropriate model may be to provide detailed information and support to enable  them to become compliant.
Footnote
24
Potential  changes to compliance and enforcement
Key informants  were asked to provide suggestions on how to improve compliance and enforcement  activities, and many identified a variety of alternative approaches that WHPP  could consider when implementing its compliance and enforcement program for the  HPA. Options suggested included:
Have  HC run its own inspectorate to conduct compliance and enforcement activities  for the HPA, no longer relying on P/T and ESDC OHS partners to conduct  inspections on behalf of the Government of Canada.
Provide  HC-funded inspectors, who would be co-located with P/T OHS inspectors, who  would focus exclusively on HPA inspections.
Enhance  interchange between WHPP and P/T and ESDC OHS inspectors, enabling WHPP to get  first-hand exposure to challenges faced by regional inspectors, and HPA  inspectors to benefit from in-person training or work terms within WHPP to get  more advanced knowledge of the HPA and HPR.
Change  the approach to inspections so that, rather than having one or two inspections  annually performed by each inspector in the regions, consider alternative  approaches, such as conducting focused inspections or conducting a smaller  number of inspections in some provinces.
Increase  reliance on paper-based inspections, similar to the audit of SDSs, by requesting  labels and SDSs directly from suppliers, thus reducing the workload that is  dependent on P/T and ESDC OHS inspectors.
Sustainability
Given WHPP’s limited capacity and resources, the  Program will not be in a position to address the challenges it faces unless  there are fundamental changes.
Sustainability of Activities and Results
Multiple elements can define the sustainability of a program. For the  purposes of this evaluation, sustainability was understood to be the ability of  a program to continue to deliver activities that meet the expectations of its  stakeholders, within available resources.
The evaluation found that WHPP had made progress towards the  achievement of key initiatives (i.e., implementation of the GHS, modernization  of the HMIRA). However, programmatic changes will be necessary in order to  support further actions, as current resource allocation limits progress towards  the achievement of expected results.
WHPP  planned budget and expenditures
The planned allocated budget of WHPP is  $3,248,642 per year, and includes 32 full-time equivalents (FTEs). Over five  years, this represents an allocated budget of about $16.2 million. Table 1  details actual WHPP expenditures from 2014-15 to 2018-19.

From 2014-15 to 2018-19, actual expenditures  were, on average, 33% higher than the appropriated budget. The implementation  of the GHS in 2015 required additional funding. Within this context, the  Consumer and Hazardous Products Safety Directorate initially reallocated about  $800,000 to support WHPP delivery. This annual funding pressure increased to  $1,330,000 from 2016-17 to 2018-19, in order to keep the Program operational,  and to address the CBI claims backlog, which had resulted from an unforeseen  increase of CBI claims (i.e., an additional 10 term FTEs paid by the  Directorate since 2018-19).
While these supplements have helped WHPP, they  are not guaranteed year after year. As productivity has reached a threshold  within its current operational setting, the Program may not be able to sustain  its achievement of expected results. Thus, WHPP is exploring options for securing  additional funding.
CBI activities
WHPP roles and responsibilities involve  activities that support the process for exemption claims due to CBI. As  previously outlined, the implementation of the GHS in 2015 introduced a requirement  for suppliers to disclose on labels and SDSs the exact concentrations of all  ingredients in their products, rather than concentration ranges, resulting in a  major increase and backlog of CBI claims.
WHPP’s financial information is not recorded by its activities (i.e.,  CBI claims, compliance and enforcement); however, various documents reviewed and  several internal key informants identified that most of WHPP resources, between  50% and 80% annually, have been used over the last five years for CBI claim  activities. Other internal estimates suggest that $2 million is spent each year  for processing CBI claims, which represents close to two-thirds of the  Program’s allocated budget.
In April 2018, the HPR was amended to reinstate the use of  concentration ranges as an option to mask proprietary information on labels and  SDSs. As a result, 20 of 117 companies submitted cancellation requests, HC  reimbursed their application fee, and the backlog of claims for exemption was  reduced by approximately 1,500 applications.
Amendments to the HMIRA  have enabled WHPP to take a risk-based approach to reviewing future CBI claims  and improve communication of their work. Amendments are expected to increase  efficiency by:
Streamlining the review of CBI  claims and allowing WHPP to focus on risk areas. Under the new amendments, WHPP  will no longer be required to review the full accuracy of labels and SDSs of  the products reviewed. This will allow WHPP to focus its resources in a  strategic fashion and allocate efforts on activities of higher risk and value,  all of which is expected to result in better protection of workers’ health and  safety.
Removing unnecessary  activities, including a lengthy and outdated appeals process, to make WHPP’s  decision-making process more agile, which will reduce regulatory burden for  both the Program and businesses.
Increasing openness and  transparency by repealing the requirements regarding the publication of  information on claims for exemption in the Canada Gazette, and the use of  registered mail for communications with claimants. WHPP will soon be able to  use timelier means to communicate decisions and information about claims once  the amendments to the HMIRA come into force.
Enabling proactive  disclosure of CBI information to other departments when there is an interest  for public health, without notification to the claimant.
While  the total number of CBI claims is expected to stabilize in light of these  changes, WHPP’s capacity will remain limited. Most of its current allocation is  still expected to be used for the treatment of CBI claims within their stabilized  number, leaving limited resources for other activities, such as compliance and  enforcement.
Cost recovery for CBI claims
WHPP collects a fee for CBI claims, but this  fee does not correspond to the actual costs of processing the claim.
Footnote
25
Internal estimates indicate that it costs approximately $9,500 to process one  CBI claim. However, fees paid by claimants are well below this estimate. Table 2  details the CBI fee structure adopted for fiscal year 2019-20. As shown in the  table, a volume discount applies based on the number of claims submitted. An  additional discount of 50% also applies for small businesses submitting claims  at each quantity level, which the table does not show.

Source: WHPP
While the fee structure for CBI claims filed under the HMIRA was  originally designed in 1988, with the intention of recovering all costs for  processing claims, this was never achieved. When the fees were last updated in  2002, the cost recovery objective was reduced to 20% to correspond to the cost  of only registering claims.
Furthermore, when the responsibilities of processing CBI claims under  the HMIRA were transferred from the Hazardous Materials Information Review  Commission to HC in 2013, all revenues were, and continue to be, deposited to  the Consolidated Revenue Fund, which has no authority to re-spend its revenues.  The fees collected to process CBI claims could no longer be invested in the  Program.
WHPP is currently working on developing and  implementing a cost-recovery regime for its CBI activities that would offset  private interests and increase revenue generation to fund the CBI portion of  the Program. Such a system could enable the Program to recoup costs associated  with CBI claims, thus giving it more flexibility to use a larger part of its  allocation budget towards compliance and enforcement activities.
Compliance and enforcement  activities
Audit work
Over the last five years, WHPP’s compliance  and enforcement activities have included an audit of 188 publically available  SDSs. CCOHS and an external contractor conducted this audit at WHPP’s request,  and it cost about $126,000.
Several internal and external key informants recognized  the high value of the information obtained through this audit, particularly  within the operating context of WHPP, where baseline data is scarce. While the resources  and capacity for such audits are limited, some key informants see conducting such  “desk audits” as a potential way for WHPP to enhance its compliance activities  and collect the needed data to better focus its future activities on addressing  key risk gaps.
Inspection activities
As  previously outlined, in accordance with MOUs created in the late 1980s and  early 1990s, P/T and ESDC OHS inspectors conduct HPA inspections on behalf of  the federal regulator. Such a model is not common in HC, as its Regulatory  Operations and Enforcement Branch typically delivers the inspection components for  other HC regulatory programs.
Still, within this unique context, WHPP, in  collaboration with its P/T and ESDC OHS partners, has managed to expand its  inspection activities in 2017. This was done through the development of an HPA  inspection training program, accompanied by HPA inspection material and  procedures. WHPP does not provide a transfer of financial resources to support  the conduct of inspections. Instead, WHPP provides their partners with training  and scientific support expertise. Several internal and external key informants  noted that P/T and ESDC OHS partners have worked hard to implement the HPA  inspection program and continue to fully engage with WHPP through committee  work. However, the same key informants also indicated that it is difficult to  maintain the increased inspection footprint, and that without additional  funding or resources, P/T and ESDC OHS partners are struggling to balance HPA  inspections with their other obligations.
Even though inspection activities have  increased, WHPP’s inspection capacity remains limited, as it relies extensively  on P/T and ESDC OHS capacity. While this arrangement is cost-effective, it  presents challenges in terms of timeliness of inspection activities and  consistency in implementation.
Furthermore, many P/T and ESDC key informants  discussed barriers to HPA inspections due to different levels of capacity and  resources between OHS partners (e.g., smaller versus larger provinces), as well  as their varying levels of HPA expertise (e.g., limited number of inspections,  approximately one to two per year per inspector, for a very technical and  complex piece of legislation). This, in turn, is seen as a barrier to  consistent implementation of the inspection program across Canada.
Based on information gathered from the  interviews and survey, there is mixed support for the current model for administering  HPA inspections. While some internal and external key informants noted that WHPP  benefits from the accessibility and regional context of P/T and ESDC OHS inspectors,  they also raised concerns that HPA inspections cannot be a priority for these  inspectors, as it constitutes a very small part of their work.
In fact, survey results suggested that HPA inspectors faced a number  of challenges when conducting HPA inspections, such as being unsure about their  role and responsibilities (33%), as well as the lack of clarity on how to assess  a SDS or label (33%). While half of the respondents (54%) noted that the HPA  inspection process is clear and well defined, some respondents provided  suggestions on how to improve the overall process. These included:
Improve training through refresher e-courses  before conducting inspections, and with concrete examples to illustrate common  issues.
Simplify inspection forms, which some  inspectors view as tedious and redundant.
Develop memory aids and checklists to increase  knowledge retention.
Simplify Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs).  SOPs are viewed as unnecessarily long and overly complicated. One respondent  noted that inspections rarely follow what the SOPs anticipate when providing  instructions.
Conclusions and Recommendations
Conclusions
What worked well
Within a complex and interlocking system  such as WHMIS, engagement and coordination with various partners and  stakeholder groups is essential. Several external and internal key informants  view WHPP’s engagement with stakeholders as one of its strengths.
Strong engagement with partners has also  helped WHPP increase the number of HPA inspections conducted since 2017 by P/T  and ESDC OHS inspectors, at no additional cost to the Program. This enhanced  partnership has contributed to the development of an inspection program that is  now conducted on a proactive basis, as opposed to the previous reactive system  where inspections were only conducted following a complaint.
WHPP has successfully led the modernization  of the HMIRA, enabling them to streamline the process for CBI claims review.  This work will allow the Program to make significant progress in addressing its  CBI backlog and enable WHPP to take a calibrated risk approach to reviewing  future CBI claims.
What the challenges are
Supplier  compliance with HPA requirements is low (e.g., compliance with SDS and label  requirements). This is an important barrier to achieving the Program’s overall  goal of informing the safe use of hazardous products in Canadian workplaces. In  the interest of worker safety, more can be done to promote and inform the safe  use of hazardous products in the workplace. However, given WHPP’s limited  capacity and resources, the Program will not be in a position to address the  challenges it faces unless there are fundamental changes.
The  current level of compliance and enforcement activities does not appear to be  sufficient, given the rates of non-compliance observed. Even though inspection  activities have increased since 2017, WHPP’s inspection capacity remains  limited, as it relies extensively on P/T and ESDC OHS capacity. While this  arrangement is cost-effective, it presents challenges in terms of capacity for  inspection activities and consistency in implementation. The evaluation also  found that the compliance enforcement tools associated with the HPA are  time-consuming to implement.
Recent changes within WHPP, such as additional  compliance promotion activities and the upcoming publication of classification  decisions (i.e., HSA),  are expected to have a positive impact on overall supplier awareness and  compliance. However, additional communication and guidance are still needed,  considering the poor compliance results to date. Data from the survey and several  external and internal key informants also identified that smaller suppliers  faced more barriers when it came to overall awareness of HPA requirements, and  that they would benefit from targeted communications. Reviewed program  documents showed limited engagement with smaller suppliers.
Consumer chemical products excluded from the HPA were found to be a  growing concern for worker safety. In particular, the evaluation found that  these products are being increasingly used in the workplace, but without adequate  hazard information to allow workers to protect themselves from extended and  repeated use. In the interest of worker safety, findings suggest that workers  need action to further inform them of the hazards of excluded products.
There is  limited information with which to assess Program impact. While WHPP has strong  data on supplier compliance from the SDS audit it conducted, the Program is  still lacking key data on hazardous products used in the workplace (e.g., a  complete list of suppliers), which limits its ability to measure overall  compliance with the HPA and HPR.
Recommendations
Recommendation #1: Consider means to increase  compliance and enforcement activities, and explore an expanded range of  enforcement tools.
Many key informants view the increase in HPA  inspections as a success. However, this function’s success will remain limited  in supporting supplier compliance unless there are programmatic changes, such as  additional enforcement tools. The Program could benefit from seeking input from  other programs within Health Canada and from international partners on their  compliance and enforcement strategies with respect to hazardous products in the  workplace.
Recommendation #2: Enhance communication and guidance material on  excluded products for all WHPP stakeholders and partners.
HPA product exclusions, especially for  consumer chemical products, is an area of concern for many stakeholders,  including inspectors, suppliers, and organized labour. For example, risks  associated with consumer chemical products used in the workplace are not  clearly communicated, and are thus misunderstood by employers and employees,  who can become at greater risk of occupational exposure. In addition to  enhancing communications on risks associated with these products, WHPP may also  want to explore how to best manage exclusions within the legislation, such as  exploring if they could be removed for some high-risk products.
Recommendation #3: Expand communication and engagement with suppliers,  in particular with small suppliers.
As suggested by the high rate of  non-compliance, supplier awareness and understanding of the HPA and HPR should  be enhanced. While the Program has developed a wide range of compliance  promotion material, interview data suggests that the full range of suppliers is  not being reached, and that information is not being understood. WHPP should  continue its partnership with the Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and  Safety in developing guidance documents and plain language material, and should  consider implementing a targeted outreach program for small suppliers.
Recommendation 4: Explore means to improve measurement of Program  impact.
Data collection could strengthen measures of Program  impact on supplier compliance and downstream effects on overall worker safety.  The Program could benefit from exploring if its existing partnerships could  leverage to improve impact measurement.
Management Response and Action Plan
Management Response and  Action Plan
WHPP  welcomes the findings from the evaluation conducted by Health Canada’s (HC)  Office of Audit and Evaluation (OAE). The Program will explore ways to leverage  current and potential partnerships to improve its delivery and implementation  using existing human and financial resources, keeping in mind the interlocking  jurisdictional system for occupational health and safety (OHS).
Recommendation 1
Consider    means to increase compliance and enforcement (C&E) activities, and    explore an expanded range of enforcement tools.
Management response
Management agrees with this recommendation.
The Program will explore options to increase its C&E activities, including    consideration of new models and enforcement tools. Since WHPP’s inspection    capacity currently relies heavily on provincial and territorial (P/T)    inspectors, as well as Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC) to    inspect federally regulated workplaces, potential options to increase C&E    activities will need to take into account implications for the interlocking    jurisdictional system in which the Program operates. The ability to undertake    new activities will need to take into consideration the availability of    current resources.

Management response
Management agrees with    this recommendation.
The    Program will continue to enhance its communication and guidance material    regarding HPA product exclusions. There are a number of product exclusions,    but consumer chemical products are considered the highest priority given that    they are commonly used in a wide range of workplaces. Organized Labour and    P/T OHS regulators have also raised the consumer chemical product exclusion    as a priority. As such, the Program’s initial focus will be on consumer    chemical products in the workplace as a priority area.

Recommendation 4
Explore means to improve measurement of program impact.
Management response
Management agrees with    this recommendation.
There is limited baseline data on workplace hazardous products. WHPP will    explore options, including partnerships, to collect and monitor relevant    information to better measure the Program’s impact. However, it is important    to recognize that there are challenges to attributing worker safety data to    the activities of WHPP in an interlocking jurisdictional system. The ability    to undertake new activities will need to take into consideration the    availability of resources.

Appendix B – Evaluation Methodology
The evaluation reviewed  Program activities from 2014-15 to 2018-19. This is the first evaluation of the  Program’s activities. The  evaluation was guided by the following three targeted questions developed in consultation with  the Program:
Results
: What result does WHPP  have on worker safety, with an enhanced focus on compliance and enforcement activities?  What challenges or barriers limit effectiveness? What baseline should WHPP use  to assess results going forward?
Efficiency
: How  efficient is WHPP’s current activity delivery model, with an enhanced focus on  compliance and enforcement activities? Are there efficiencies to be found? How  does the model compare to other jurisdictions?
Sustainability
: How  sustainable are WHPP’s results? What impact does the funding model have on  Program results? Would a cost-recovery regime be practical and beneficial?
The evaluation findings are based on multiple lines of evidence,  including the following data sources:
Academic and Grey Literature
A scan of relevant  peer-reviewed and grey literature published between 2014-15 and 2018-19 was  conducted, with support from HC’s Health Library Information Branch. A total of  25 articles were selected for inclusion.
Document and Files
Program staff at WHPP  provided administrative and policy documentation for evaluators to review. A  total of 305 internal files were reviewed.
Comparative Analysis
Comparative analysis of  hazard communication systems in other jurisdictions, including the UK, the US,  and Australia was conducted. The analysis was based on a review of public  program documents and academic literature.
Key Informant Interviews
Evaluators conducted 42  interviews with a total of 45 key informants, 21 key informants internal to HC  and 24 external key informants, including:
P/T and ESDC  WHMIS Coordinators: 15
Industry: 2
Organized  Labour: 4
CCOHS: 2
CAALL –  Occupational Safety and Health: 1
Emerging themes from interviews were identified and quantified using  NVIVO qualitative analysis software.
Financial Data
Program staff provided financial data on planned and actual Program expenditures.  This data was used to assess the extent to which funding was spent as  anticipated, and to examine the sustainability of the Program.
Survey of HPA Inspectors  (response rate of 31%)
HPA inspectors from P/T and  ESDC OHS authorities were asked to participate in a survey to gather their  views on the HPA training they received, the HPA inspections they conducted, and  the HPA inspection material they used. Voxco software was used to administer  the survey to the participants and track their results.
Case Study
The evaluation examined a  case study, resulting from an HPA inspection, to identify successes, challenges, and lessons  learned.
Data was analyzed by triangulating information gathered  from the different methods listed above. The use of multiple lines of evidence  and triangulation was intended to increase the reliability and credibility of  the evaluation findings and conclusions. Still, most evaluations face  constraints that may affect the validity and reliability of evaluation findings  and conclusions. The following table  outlines the limitations encountered during the implementation of the selected  methods for this evaluation and mitigation strategies put in place to ensure  that the evaluation findings are sufficiently robust.
Evaluation Methodology
Limitation
Impact
Mitigation Strategy
Research    on the impact of workplace hazardous products on Canadian workers is limited    and mostly associated with broader occupational health and safety.
There    are limited peer-reviewed academic publications and overall data on workplace    exposure to hazardous products.
Grey literature and international sources    were used to supplement the literature review.
Key informant    interviews are retrospective in nature, providing recent perspective on past    events.
This    can affect the validity of assessments of activities or results that may have    changed over time.
Triangulation with other lines of evidence    substantiated or provided further information on data captured in interviews.    Document review also provided corporate knowledge.
The    administration and regulation of workplace hazardous products under WHMIS is    done through a multi-jurisdictional partnership system.
Limited    the ability to assess WHPP’s impact on informing the safe use of hazardous    products by workers.
Interviews with WHMIS coordinators in each    jurisdiction provided insight on HC’s general contribution within the    multi-stakeholder system.
Due to    the current financial data reporting procedures at HC, limited information on    human resource (i.e., Full-time equivalent – FTE) allocation per Program    activity was available.
Limited    the ability to assess the efficiency and sustainability of current Program activities    in relation to number of FTEs.
Estimation of FTEs allocated to WHPP    activities were conducted by the Program.
Performance    measurement data and information were limited
Performance    data was limited to supplier compliance, which made it difficult to assess    the Program’s subsequent impacts on workers safety.
Other lines of evidence, such as file and    document review and key informant interviews, were used to help provide as    clear a picture as possible of activities’ impacts on workers.
Low    response rate on HPA inspector survey (31%)
Lack of    meaningful trend information for some survey questions.
Results from the survey were triangulated    with other lines of evidence (i.e., key informant interviews and document    review) to substantiate survey data.

Appendix D – International  Comparison
Description of US Model
The equivalent of    Canada’s WHMIS system in the US is the Hazard Communication Standard (HCS)    program. The US Department of Labor’s Occupational Health and Safety    Administration (OSHA) is the governing body responsible for its    administration. The HCS falls under the Occupational Safety and Health (OSH)    Act and is implemented by the OSHA or a State, depending on whether they have    an OSHA-approved state plan.
Footnote
26
Description of US Model
Disclosure    of CBI
Compliance and Enforcement
Role of Supplier, Employer and Worker
A manufacturer may    provide an ingredient concentration range on its SDS instead of an exact    concentration, but it must indicate that the exact concentration has been    withheld as a trade secret. Prior approval from OSHA to protect confidential    business information (CBI) is not required and no fees are charged.
OSHA inspectors, also    known as compliance safety and health officers, are responsible for    implementing the compliance and enforcement program and regulating OSHA    legislation. OSHA created a Directive that outlines the inspection procedures    for the HCS. The Directive provides inspection guidance for hazard    classification, the written hazard communication program, labels, and other    forms of warning, SDSs, employee training, as well as trade secrets. Given    the large number of worksites that OSHA oversees (approximately seven million),    the Agency has taken a targeted approach by identifying six inspection    priorities: imminent danger situations, severe injuries and illnesses, worker    complaints, referral, targeted inspections, and follow-up inspections.
Footnote
27
Manufacturers    classify the hazards and prepare labels and SDSs based on classifications
Employers    must prepare a written hazard communication program, including a list of    hazardous chemicals in the workplace.
Workers    are trained by the employer on program elements, hazards, and protective    measures
Footnote
28
Lessons Learned and Best Practices
Compliance advice
Compliance    Assistance Specialists provide information on the different compliance    resources that are available, as well as information on how to comply with    the OSHA standards. Compliance Assistance Specialists are responsible for the    promotion and implementation of OSHA’s cooperative program, which includes    the Voluntary Protection Programs, the Strategic Partnership Program, the    Alliance Program, and the OSHA Challenge Program. In general, these programs    help support collaborative efforts between various stakeholders (unions,    employers, workers, consulates, trade or professional organizations,    businesses, faith- and community-based organizations and educational    institutions, etc.) in an effort to improve and raise awareness of worker    health and safety.
Footnote
29
OSHA also provides on-site consultation through its On-Site Consultation    Program. The Program offers free confidential occupational safety and health    services to small- and medium-sized businesses across the country. On-site    consultations are separate from inspections and cannot result in violations    or citations.
Footnote
30
Sharing success    stories
The US    OSHA publishes success stories and case studies on their website to highlight    lessons learned and best practices. They also have a program called the    Safety and Health Recognition Program that recognizes exemplary workplace    safety and health programs implemented by small businesses. Highlights from    these success stories include hazards that OSHA’s voluntary On-Site    Consultation has helped identify, methods companies have implemented to    correct hazards, business practices that have changed to prevent injuries and    illnesses, as well as challenges and successes.
Footnote
31
Description    of UK Model
In    the UK, the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) is the government agency    responsible for the oversight of the laws and regulations related to    workplace hazardous products. More broadly, the HSE is responsible for the    regulation and enforcement of occupational health and safety legislation,    which includes the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act. In relation to    workplace hazardous products, the HSE, with local authorities, enforces the    Control of Substances Hazardous to Health Regulations 2003 (COSHH), the Classification,    Labelling and Packaging of Chemicals Regulations 2015 (CLP) and the    Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals    Regulation (REACH).
Footnote
32
The CLP, combined with    REACH, are the equivalent of the HPA. The REACH Regulation and the CLP    Regulation work together to provide hazard communications tools. The    provisions under COSHH target employers, but are regulated by the HSE.
Footnote
33
Description of UK Model
Disclosure of CBI
Compliance and Enforcement
Role of Supplier, Employer and Worker
Companies    who are concerned about disclosing the full composition of a mixture in an    SDS or on product labels can request the use of an alternative chemical name    for a hazardous substance to protect their trade secrets. The request must be    submitted to European Chemicals Agency (ECHA). A fee also needs to be paid,    in accordance with the EU CLP regulation. However, as per the ECHA manual on    dissemination and confidentiality under the REACH regulation, “information    listed under REACH Article 119(1) will always be disseminated, regardless of    whether a registrant attempts to request this information confidential.    Additionally, the information listed under REACH Article 119(2) will also be    disseminated unless a confidentiality request has been submitted and accepted    as valid, and the relevant fee paid if applicable.”
Footnote
34
The    HSE implements the compliance and enforcement policy. The policy is known as    the Enforcement Policy Statement (EPS). The HSE works in collaboration with    other regulators, agencies, and government departments to ensure that the    most appropriate organization intervenes. They also work with Local    Authorities (LA) in lower-risk workplaces such as offices, shops, warehouses,    and consumer services. To ensure a consistent, proportionate, and targeted    approach to regulation based on risk, the HSE developed the LA National    Enforcement Code in 2013 and supplementary guidance material for LA    inspectors. In addition to these tools, the HSE also created the Health and    Safety Executive/Local Authority Enforcement Liaison Committee (HELA) to    support coordination efforts around compliance and enforcement.
Footnote
35
Employers    are responsible for taking effective measures to control exposure and protect    health. Effective measures include finding out what the health hazards are    from a product; providing control measures to reduce harm to health; making    sure they are used; providing information, instruction, and training for    employees and others; and providing monitoring and health surveillance in    appropriate cases, among others.
Footnote
36
Under    REACH, the manufacturer or importer is responsible for assessing the risk    from substances manufactured or imported in quantities of 10 or more tonnes    per year in the EU, as well as developing exposure scenarios and identify    Risk Management Measures.
Footnote
37
Lessons Learned and Best Practices
Supporting consistency of approach through    guidance and committee work
The    UK model relies on various Local Authorities (LA) to conduct enforcement    activities, similar to the Canadian system that uses P/T partners to conduct    inspections. To ensure a consistent approach to health and safety regulations    based on risk, the HSE developed a National Enforcement Code for LA,    accompanied by supplementary guidance material for local authority    inspectors. In addition to these tools, the UK also created HELA to support    coordination efforts related to compliance and enforcement.
Footnote
38
Such a committee is    similar to the IWCC that the WHPP created to discuss compliance and    enforcement activities conducted by F/P/T partners.
Targeted information for businesses,    including small businesses
The    UK model also supports a number of advisory committees and industry groups,    including the Strategy of the Small Business Trade Association (SBTAF).    Membership is open to any such trade associations and provides an excellent    opportunity to access and share information with other organizations,    industries, and sectors that face similar issues. Through this group, the HSE    seeks to raise awareness and communicate information on health and safety    issues facing small- and medium-sized enterprises across many diverse    industry sectors.
Footnote
39
Description    Australia’s Model
Safe    Work Australia (SWA) is the governing body that oversees workplace hazardous    products, and more broadly, occupational health and safety in the workplace.    They are a government statutory body jointly funded by the Commonwealth,    state, and territorial governments through an intergovernmental agreement.    Similar to the Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety (CCOHS),    the SWA is a tripartite body that works in partnership with government,    employers, and labour. As a national policy body, they are not responsible    for regulating Work Health and Safety (WHS) laws, as regulation and    enforcement lies with the Commonwealth, state, and territories within their    jurisdictions.
Footnote
40
Description Australia’s Model
Disclosure of CBI
Compliance and Enforcement
Role of Supplier, Employer and Worker
Only    in specific instances is the use of a generic name for a hazardous ingredient    permitted (moderate hazard category and if no occupational exposure limit is    established). If the exact concentration of an ingredient is considered    confidential, the concentration of the ingredient can be disclosed using    prescribed ranges.
Footnote
41
The    SWA is not responsible for regulation. Compliance and enforcement lies with    the Commonwealth, state, and territories. WHS laws only becomes legally    binding if these entities adopt them as their own law. WHS law encompasses    the WHS Act, the WHS Regulations, and the various Codes of Practice developed    to guide regulators, manufacturers, employers, workers, and medical    practitioners. The National Compliance and Enforcement Policy (NCEP) supports    WHS regulators in implementing these various elements in their jurisdictions.
Footnote
42
Suppliers:    ensuring that chemicals they supply are without risks to health and safety,    and providing SDSs with hazardous chemicals.
Manufacturer    or importer: ensuring that chemicals they supply are without risks to health    and safety, correctly classifying the chemicals that they import or    manufacture, and preparing correct labels and SDSs for those labels.
Employers:    maintaining a register and manifest, where required, of hazardous chemicals;    identifying any risk of hazards; ensuring workplace exposure standards for    hazardous chemicals are not exceeded; providing health and monitoring to    workers, if relevant; providing information, training, instruction, and    supervision to workers, among others.
Footnote
43
Lessons Learned and Best Practices
Various compliance tools for various purposes
A literature review undertaken by Safe Work Australia found that small and    large businesses could potentially benefit from different regulation models.    For large businesses, a model that focuses on easy access to information and    strict enforcement of non-compliance may be more effective, whereas for small    businesses, a more appropriate model may be to provide detailed information    and support to enable them to become compliant. From a policy perspective,    other lessons learned included considering how voluntary partnerships and    incentive schemes could be of value for businesses.
Footnote
44
Targeted information for businesses,    including small businesses
Safe Work Australia recently conducted a review of the Workplace Health and Safety    laws. Data from the review showed that businesses found it difficult to    navigate through the legislative framework to identify the aspects that applied    to them. As such, Australian business and industry representatives suggested    more practical guidance on how to comply with the Workplace Health and Safety    regulations, with some calling for more industry-specific guidance, as    opposed to issue-specific guidance. Safe Work Australia also found that small    businesses were unclear about how to assess hazards in their workplace,    including what actions to take to fulfil their obligations. Small business    advocates consulted as part of the review noted that the Workplace Health and    Safety model is designed for big businesses and does not reflect the reality    of small businesses. As a result, the report suggested that regulators should    focus on helping small businesses translate Workplace Health and Safety    regulations within the context of their own workplaces, as well as assistance    with implementation.
