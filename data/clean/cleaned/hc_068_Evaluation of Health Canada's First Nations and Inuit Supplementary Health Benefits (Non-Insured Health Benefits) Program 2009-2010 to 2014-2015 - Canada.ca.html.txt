Executive Summary
The purpose of the evaluation was to assess the relevance and performance of Health Canada’s First Nations and Inuit Supplementary Health Benefits (Non-Insured Health Benefits) Program (NIHB Program) for the period of 2009-2010 to 2014-2015.
The evaluation was required in accordance with Section 42.1 of the Financial Administration Act, and the Treasury Board of Canada’s Policy on Evaluation (2009). The evaluation has been conducted to provide Health Canada’s senior management, central agencies, Ministers, Parliamentarians and Canadians with a credible and neutral assessment of the ongoing relevance and performance (defined in terms of effectiveness, efficiency and economy) of the NIHB Program. More specifically, the evaluation will provide the Deputy Minister of Health Canada, as well as senior management, with reliable information to support decision-making regarding the achievements made by the NIHB Program in providing supplementary health benefits to registered First Nations individuals and recognized Inuit living in Canada.
The NIHB Program is a long-established national health benefits program administered through the First Nations and Inuit Health Branch (FNIHB) at Health Canada. Under its 1997 Cabinet-approved mandate, which builds from the 1979 Indian Health Policy, the Program provides eligible First Nations people (both on- and off-reserve) and recognized Inuit residents of Canada with supplemental health benefits in a manner that contributes to their improved health status.
As of March 2015, the NIHB Program was available to approximately 825,000 eligible registered First Nations individuals and recognized Inuit, regardless of their place of residence in Canada. The Program provides access to a range of medically necessary, health-related goods and services when these benefits are not otherwise provided to eligible clients through private or provincial/territorial (P/T) programs. Program benefits include: pharmacy, medical supplies and equipment (MS&E), dental care, vision care, short-term crisis intervention mental health counselling (STCIMHC), and medical transportation (MT) to access medically required health services not available on-reserve or in the community of residence.
The NIHB Program is a large program which expended approximately $5.8 billion over the six-year period covered by this evaluation (2009-2010 to 2014-2015, inclusive), and processes a significant number of health benefit claims annually. For example, over 17 million paid claims in pharmacy products, MS&E and dental care benefits were processed in 2014-2015.
The objective of the NIHB Program is to provide non-insured health benefits to eligible First Nations people and Inuit in a manner that:
is appropriate to their unique health needs;
contributes to the achievement of an overall health status for First Nations people and Inuit that is comparable to that of the Canadian population as a whole;
is sustainable from a fiscal and benefit management perspective; and,
facilitates First Nations/Inuit control at a time and pace of their choosing.
Findings and Conclusions on Relevance
There is a strong and continued need for the NIHB Program, given the health disparities faced by First Nations and Inuit populations when compared to non-Indigenous Canadians. The Program responds to identified health needs by providing benefits and services that may not be available to clients in its absence.
In the absence of the Program, most members of the eligible population would be without key supports, benefits and services that they require to improve and/or maintain their health status. Given the high rates of chronic and acute disease among First Nations and Inuit populations, combined with the ongoing challenges of accessing culturally safe health care services and the socio-economic conditions for many communities, the services and benefits provided under the NIHB Program are an essential component of ongoing efforts to diminish substantial health disparities with the rest of Canadians that currently exist for First Nations individuals and Inuit.
The NIHB Program clearly aligns with key federal government priorities, as well as Health Canada’s strategic outcomes.
Health Canada, through FNIHB, provides health programs and services to First Nations individuals and Inuit based on departmental mission and Cabinet-approved mandate/policy statements. Improving the health of Indigenous people is a shared responsibility between federal, P/T governments and Indigenous partners. A key guiding principle in situations where benefits are covered under another plan is to have the NIHB Program act as a primary facilitator in coordinating payments, in order to ensure that the other plan meets its obligations and that clients are not denied service.
Findings and Conclusions on Performance
Clients are accessing the NIHB Program with utilization rates that have remained relatively constant throughout the period covered by the evaluation, for those benefit areas that could be assessed through administrative data (i.e., pharmacy, dental and MS&E benefit areas). The Program provided more than 825,000 eligible clients with access to benefits in 2014-2015. During this same year, approximately three-quarters (72%) of eligible clients had received at least one pharmacy, dental and/or MS&E benefit. The pharmacy benefit area had the highest annual utilization rate ranging from 63% to 66% of eligible clients, who had at least one paid pharmacy claim within a given year (between 441,000 and 499,000 individuals each year). This was followed by the dental benefit area at 35% to 38% of eligible clients (between 249,000 and 288,000 individuals each year), and the MS&E benefit area at 7% of eligible clients (between 51,000 and 56,000 individuals each year).
Some clients accessing NIHB Program benefits encountered various challenges and barriers. Of the challenges cited for each of the benefit areas, many were related to issues of awareness of coverage inclusions/exclusions, rather than accessibility of a benefit. Challenges related to coordination of benefits between the NIHB and provincial programs were noted as an example of an issue that is within the purview of Health Canada to adjust. The funding of NIHB Navigator positions, who assist clients in accessing Program benefits, has helped with coordination.
Decisions and policies related to pharmacy benefits are the most highly evidence-based, with dental and MS&E benefit decisions and policies actively using and integrating scientific evidence. The nature of the decisions required for each benefit area differs, with these three areas (pharmacy, dental, MS&E) being most closely reliant on current scientific evidence to effectively administer benefits. Administrative data, such as claims-level utilization data, were found to be incomplete in some benefit areas. Such challenges reduce the Program’s ability to analyze these data and use the results to inform planning, policy development, and Program adjustments. This is particularly the case in the MT benefit area, a significant portion of which is managed through contribution agreements.
Compliance is effectively monitored for three of the six benefit areas: pharmacy, dental and MS&E. The other three benefit areas, while not having a systematic and centralized audit program, have had internal and/or external audits during the period covered by the evaluation. The audits have resulted in recommendations for improvements in assuring client and provider compliance. The Program has taken steps to address the various recommendations (e.g., regional MT audits, national provider enrollment processes for vision care and STCIMHC).
Overall, the demonstration of expected outcomes is hampered by administrative data issues for some benefit areas (e.g., MT, STCIMHC, vision care), particularly related to data completeness and consistency. The delivery of two of the larger benefit areas (pharmacy, dental) is largely done from national headquarters, which contributes to a more systematic collection of administrative data supporting measurement and ongoing monitoring of outputs and outcomes. While MT benefits account for approximately one-third of Program expenditures, incomplete administrative data present a challenge to systematically measure and monitor outputs and outcomes.
The NIHB Program is large and complex, with multiple benefit areas, various delivery systems, and is subject to important cost drivers that can be volatile and are, for the most part, beyond the control of the Program. These cost drivers have the potential of placing significant pressures on expenditures and contribute to the challenges of managing such a large and complex Program. Despite this context, during the period covered by the evaluation, the Program managed to maintain overall expenditure growth to within the range of overall eligible population growth.
Specific indicators of efficiency, such as administrative costs per claim, demonstrate that the benefit areas with greater administrative consolidation (pharmacy, dental and, to some extent, MS&E) are maintaining efficiency. Some contributors to maintained efficiency include negotiated administration costs, established fee grids, an integrated transaction system, and the availability of administrative data that can be used to clearly monitor and assess the efficiency of claims management for these benefit areas. For those benefit areas with less administrative consolidation (MT, vision care, STCIMHC), it is challenging to determine levels of efficiency, given incomplete administrative data on outputs that can be linked to costs. As such, there may be opportunities to consider greater administrative consolidation in some of these areas.
Recommendation 1
Review and streamline NIHB Program coordination of benefits procedures and practices with other publicly and privately funded supplementary health benefit plans to ensure clarity, minimize delays and facilitate client access to benefits.
The evaluation found that clients and partners experienced challenges with NIHB Program processes used to coordinate benefits with other publicly and privately funded supplementary health benefit plans. Ambiguity in coordination of benefit procedures is, in part, attributable to the lack of clarity of the NIHB Program as a ‘payer of last resort' among benefit plans, which may result in unnecessary delays and confusion for clients in accessing health benefits. Additional efforts by the Program to clarify and streamline coordination of benefits processes and communications would lead to improved clarity and potentially improved benefit and service delivery for First Nations individuals and Inuit.
Recommendation 2
Consider conducting a strategic analysis, in specific geographic areas, to support the enhancement of local health services to improve access to care and to progressively reduce MT benefit expenditures where feasible.
MT benefits, unlike other benefit areas, cannot be linked directly to an individual's health status and treatment needs. The MT benefit area is more a function of where individuals reside than of their health status and treatment needs. Similarly, cost drivers, suppliers and the nature of the services provided under the MT benefit area are relatively unique when compared to the other NIHB Program benefit areas, and possibly more challenging to consolidate administratively. These differences, combined with some of the data integrity challenges encountered in monitoring and evaluating MT benefits, indicate that potential alternative management models for the MT benefit area could be further explored.
Recommendation 3
Consider greater standardization of administrative data collection for MT, vision care and STCIMHC benefits across regions to improve monitoring and demonstration of Program-level outcomes, such as access (e.g., utilization rates, approvals, denials, appeals).
While the NIHB Program currently collects a large amount of data, there are some challenges with data integrity in three of the benefit areas, namely MT, vision care and STCIMHC benefits. There is a need to improve data collection across regions for these three benefit areas, so that the Program can monitor and demonstrate Program-level outcomes, related specifically to accessibility of benefits. Improving data collection for the MT benefit area is a priority, given its substantial growth combined with its significant proportion of total Program expenditures during the evaluation period.
9.2  Managed in a Sustainable Manner
Is the Program better able to evaluate benefit management and predict/respond to new/changing cost pressures?
The NIHB Program has implemented detailed processes and systems to monitor expenditures on a monthly and quarterly basis for most benefit areas. This contributes to the Program having the capacity to track and quickly update within-year budgets and make adjustments as required. The Program has tended to operate within a -2% to 6% variance from budgeted or forecasted expenditures over the period covered by the evaluation. The evaluation found that accurate forecasting beyond a one-year time frame was challenging for the Program given the large number of potential cost drivers and their volatility. The Program is currently developing and implementing a five-year forecasting model that considers cost drivers and combines this information with historical expenditure patterns across the specific benefit areas.
In-Year Monitoring
As one indication of the extent to which the NIHB Program can evaluate benefit management and respond to new and changing cost pressures in the short term, the evaluation examined in-year monitoring for Program expenditures. During the six-year period covered by the evaluation, the NIHB Program had numerous policies and procedures in place to monitor ongoing expenditures for the various benefit areas, namely:
Monthly forecasting fee-for-service pharmacy and dental claims through claims processor: NIHB Program HQ is responsible for preparing a monthly forecast for these funds, which represent approximately 55% of the entire Program benefits funding envelope. Two separate methodologies are utilized to forecast these funds, depending on which period of the fiscal year is being considered. In early fiscal year periods (months three through five), the monthly fee-for-service forecast is calculated using year-to-date actuals divided by the proportion of the previous fiscal year's spending for that period. This proportional method serves to adjust for historical period fluctuations, such as a consistent annual spending lag in summer months. From period six onwards, the monthly fee-for-service forecast is calculated using year-to-date actuals multiplied by the weighted days remaining in the fiscal year. Weighted day calculations account for weekday business days versus weekend days and holidays in the calendar year, by region.

Regional forecasts: Regions submit their monthly forecasts for regionally managed benefits for periods three through 11. Regionally managed benefits represent approximately 45% of the NIHB Program benefits funding envelope. Once regions have submitted their forecasts, Program HQ reviews regional values, making adjustments to the forecasts as required. Capacity and accuracy in preparing monthly forecasts varies by region, in that some regions forecast what they believe they will spend, while others simply forecast to their allocation.
Another indication of the in-year monitoring of the NIHB Program includes the extent to which the Program can manage expenditures within budgets established at the beginning of each year. For the final two years of the evaluation period (2013-2014 to 2014-2015), the evaluation found that NIHB Program expenditures followed relatively closely the annual budget for each of those two years. As noted in Table 17, for these two years combined, the expenditures were approximately 3% lower than budget.
The NIHB Program provided the evaluation team with information on in-house variance analysis regarding the accuracy of a series of in-year forecasting exercises. While the values used did not align with expenditures and budgets provided to the evaluation team by Health Canada's Chief Financial Officer Branch, likely due to different sets of inclusions/exclusions used with each of the two sources, the results of the Program's analyses indicated that, for the period covered by the evaluation, the in-year expenditures were very close to the amount forecasted at the start of the year. As illustrated in Table 18, the overall expenditures, according to the Program's own analyses, was $6.25 billion, which was quite close to the $6.35 billion forecasted through an annual prediction, or approximately 2% positive variance for the entire period covered by the evaluation. Overall, the benefit area that demonstrated the highest level of variance was MT, showing a positive variance of approximately 6%.
Forecasting
The evaluation found that the factors contributing to fluctuations in NIHB Program expenditures and their growth rate are numerous, and can be difficult to forecast accurately due to their volatility and/or limited information available. This creates a challenge in being able to forecast Program costs beyond a one-year time frame. From the document review, interviews with industry representatives and discussions with Program representatives, the evaluation team developed a list of potential cost drivers that could substantially impact Program expenditures within the various benefit areas. As illustrated in Table 19 below, most of the potential cost drivers could have either a positive or negative impact on NIHB Program costs. The magnitude of the impact of most cost drivers could also vary considerably depending on many factors that fall far outside of the NIHB Program's realm of control. Except for a few of the more steadily growing drivers (e.g., demographic changes), there are considerable challenges involved in accurately predicting the direction and exact magnitude of the impact on NIHB Program costs when forecasting out five or 10 years.
The NIHB Program is currently developing a five-year forecasting model for all benefit areas. According to documentation provided by the Program, the approach involves focusing on both recent expenditure growth and eligible population growth (the NIHB Program's client base grows at a rate nearly double that of the general Canadian population). The methodology has been designed to incorporate historical factors that drove expenditure growth over the preceding two years, while also controlling for variability in expenditures caused by changes in P/T drug pricing policies, backlogs in claims processing, or the use of accounting practices that can affect year-end results.
Is the Program managed in a cost-effective and sustainable manner?
The NIHB Program experienced an average annual expenditure growth rate of approximately 4% across the period of the evaluation, which is comparable to the growth rates of health public expenditures, according to Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI). The ratio of administration costs to benefit expenditures for the NIHB Program was assessed at approximately 3% in 2014-2015. This ratio is in the low end of the range, when compared with various private sector plans that reported variability in administrative costs according to plan size, complexity and delivery.
The extent to which the Program is managed in a cost-effective and sustainable manner is related to measuring efficiency while achieving outcomes and containing costs. The evaluation attempted to assess this area with two main indicators: growth in expenditures compared to other plans and Canadian trends, and the ratio of administration costs to benefit expenditures compared to industry benchmarks. Comparators of growth rates and industry benchmarks were not readily available from industry sources consulted for the evaluation (e.g., document review, interviews with industry representatives).
As noted previously in Section 9.1, the average annual growth rate was approximately 4% for NIHB Program expenditures, ranging from 3% to 5%. While not an exact comparison, based on CIHI estimates, average annual growth in health public expenditures was 7% between 2000 and 2010, decreased to 2.9% between 2010 and 2013, and reached 3.1% in 2014 (CIHI, 2015). This would indicate that the expenditure growth exhibited by the NIHB Program is within the range of other health public expenditures.
The ratio of administration costs to benefit expenditures for the NIHB Program was assessed as approximately 3% in 2014-2015. Information on the share of administrative costs for public plans was unavailable for the evaluation, as the differences in delivery approaches, coverage and definitions used to track information between the various plans did not allow for a comparison. Private and non-profit plans reported that administrative costs would vary with size, complexity and delivery of a program, and the share of total costs quoted ranged from as low 3.5% to as high as 12%.
During discussions and interviews with NIHB Program representatives, several areas and processes were highlighted as contributing to cost management and the overall cost-effectiveness of the Program during the period covered by the evaluation. Examples included systematic integration of operations for some of the benefit areas, increased automation of claims, negotiation of pharmacy fees, establishment of regional fee grids for dental service providers, and reduction in prior approval/predetermination requirements for those procedures with very high approval rates. Policies and agreements were also highlighted as contributing to cost management, such as the Short-Term Dispensing Policies implemented during the period covered by the evaluation, and various Product Listing Agreements dating from 2010, which allow the NIHB Program to provide clients with more open access to newer and higher-cost medications.
It was noted that a unique feature of the NIHB Program, when compared to other plans, is its emphasis on various aspects of client safety. The processes implemented to advocate client safety may contribute initially to costs, but may improve overall effectiveness with respect to outcomes, such as improved health and wellbeing. Various procedures have been implemented in areas such as opiate prescribing and frequency of prescriptions.
9.3  Comparisons with Other Programs and Plans
How does the Program compare with similar publicly/privately funded plans?
In comparison with other plans examined for the evaluation, the NIHB Program is unique in not requiring co-payment. The NIHB Program's coverage of pharmacy, MS&E and vision care benefits is comparable to that provided by other publicly funded plans. Nonetheless, these plans are often restricted to specific groups considered to be vulnerable populations (e.g., social assistance recipients, people with disabilities, seniors, children), and are not available to the general Canadian population. The NIHB Program's dental benefits coverage is generally superior to that found among other publicly funded plans. The Program's approach to processing claims is similar to that of many other plans, with increasing use of electronic claim submission and built-in audit and approval algorithms. It is challenging to compare NIHB Program coverage with private plans, given the large variation among the latter.
It is challenging to compare the NIHB Program directly with other plans, as there is considerable variety and options both within and between different types of plans. There were no adequate comparisons found for MT, as this is not normally covered as an individually-based benefit in either the private or public plans examined. Similarly, the STCIMHC benefit area is difficult to compare due to limited coverage for these types of services under other public plans, and variation in counselling and psychotherapy benefits available through private plans. Therefore, the evaluation selected a few comparative dimensions for four NIHB Program benefit areas, namely pharmacy, dental, MS&E and vision care.
Pharmacy Benefits
As noted in Table 20, key differences between the NIHB Program's pharmacy benefits and other benefit plans were the following:
The NIHB Program does not require clients to co-pay any proportion of the benefits. Most other plans examined have some level of co-payment.
NIHB Program coverage includes some non-prescription drugs. The other plans examined did not provide coverage for non-prescription drugs.
The NIHB Program's pharmacy benefits do not differ substantially from the other plans examined with respect to claims processing or requirements for prior approval.
Dental Benefits
As noted in Table 21, key differences between the NIHB Program's dental benefits and other benefit plans were the following:
The NIHB Program does not require clients to co-pay any proportion of the benefits. NIHB Program benefits are not set with deductibles or maximum annual allowances. Most other plans examined have some level of co-payment, deductible, annual maximum or both.
NIHB Program coverage is considerably more extensive than the publicly funded plans examined.
NIHB Program predetermination is primarily paper-based, while the other plans tend to use electronic processing for predetermination.
The NIHB Program's dental benefit coverages did not differ substantially from the other plans examined with respect to the use of predetermination and regional fee grids/schedules to guide amounts claimed.
MS&E Benefits
As noted in Table 22, key differences between the NIHB Program's MS&E benefits and other benefit plans were the following:
The NIHB Program does not require clients to co-pay any proportion of the benefits. Most other plans examined do have at least some level of co-payment.
NIHB Program coverage is all under the one program, while many of the public programs appear to be very specific to certain needs (e.g., aids to independent living).
NIHB Program claims processing is primarily electronic, while the public-funded plans appear to have more paper-based processing in comparison.
The NIHB Program's MS&E benefits did not differ substantially from the other plans examined with respect to the requirement of prior approval for many items, more specifically equipment.
Vision Care Benefits
As noted in Table 23, key differences between the NIHB Program's vision care benefits and other benefit plans were the following:
The NIHB Program does not require clients to co-pay any proportion of the benefits. Most other plans examined do have at least some level of co-payment.
NIHB Program claims processing is primarily paper-based, while the private insurance plans appear to have more electronic-based processing.
The NIHB Program requires prior approval, while private insurance plans tend to work with maximum coverage amounts.
The NIHB Program's vision care benefits did not differ substantially from the other public plans examined with respect to restrictions on frequency of examinations and on models of eyewear.
The private and non-profit sectors are moving towards greater customization in health benefit insurance coverage (e.g., health spending account, wellness, prevention and allied/paramedical health services).
Through the benchmarking exercise, the evaluation found that private and non-profit sector health insurance plans favour customization in coverage (i.e., plan sponsors choose the most appropriate plan for members). Furthermore, plan sponsors (e.g., employers) may choose to offer plan members (e.g., employees) a fixed plan or a flexible/modular plan with options. There appears to be some customization, depending on the public sector programs (e.g., decentralized delivery models, types of coverage); however, fixed plans seem more common in public sector organizations. In comparison, the NIHB Program establishes national policy frameworks to support the Program’s mandate to provide nationally consistent and portable benefits. In the case of regionally managed benefit areas, the Program’s regional offices work within these frameworks to implement coverage in a manner that reflects differences across and within regions (e.g., available P/T coverage and location of P/T health services, delivery of benefits through CA and/or contract provider as needed).
It was also found that providing the option to plan members of having a health spending account is an increasingly common practice among private and non-profit health insurance plans. In an analysis of health benefits by the Conference Board of Canada, it was found that 65% of public organizations offer a health spending account to their plan members.
In keeping with the customization and tailoring of coverage, the evaluation found that private and non-profit insurers are increasingly developing coverage based on a holistic approach to health care that includes wellness, prevention, and allied/paramedical health services; however, offering paramedical services is a cost driver for many plans. Some coverage for allied/paramedical services is observed in government-sponsored programs. In comparison, the NIHB Program provides no coverage for allied services, or for mental health services other than those addressing a crisis.
Use of IT is common practice among private and non-profit plans (e.g., electronic processing, increased used of mobile applications to disseminate information and manage benefits, and websites with information organized by client type and coverage).
Electronic processing is a common practice among private and non-profit insurance companies and government supplemental health insurance programs, particularly for drug and dental benefits, and is being implemented for other benefits. Alternatively, fax and phone are used with very little reliance on paper records. In comparison, although the NIHB Program uses electronic processing for drug and dental benefits, processing of predetermination and prior approvals relies heavily on paper submissions, which may impact efficiency. According to Program representatives, this requirement is based on government policy related to privacy requirements for transmitting personal health information.
Private and non-profit insurance companies are increasingly using mobile applications to disseminate information and manage benefits. These applications are not in use by the NIHB Program and could potentially contribute to clarifying service eligibility for clients.
Private and non-profit insurance companies have well-developed websites with information organized by client type and coverage. Information on the NIHB Program’s website is generally difficult to find or unclear. Most partners interviewed were critical of the web-based information and client bulletins available from the NIHB Program. While this evaluation was underway, key NIHB information on the Health Canada website was being revised and migrated to the new Government of Canada site, with the intention of improving clarity and access to web-based Program information.
Predetermination and prior approval are becoming more common in private and non-profit insurance plans in order to contain costs and, while timeliness is a performance measure, coordination with other benefits is a priority.
Predetermination and prior approvals are becoming more common in the private and non-profit sectors in order to contain costs. In comparison, the challenges observed with the NIHB Program are linked to the complexity of the approval process, the greater number of benefits that must be submitted for predetermination or prior approval when compared to some other plans, and the limited automation or availability of electronic processing in some benefit areas.
Timeliness is considered a performance measure in private and non-profit plans. In comparison, the NIHB Program publishes service standards for dental benefits and STCIMHC benefits, while, for the other benefits, there are internal Program metrics available.
Ensuring that other sources of insurance coverage are taken into consideration before paying for benefits is a priority for private and non-profit plans. Although the NIHB Program is presented as a ‘payer of last resort’, it is treated as a first payer by most supplemental health benefit provincial programs and some private plans. During interviews with partners and NIHB Program representatives, it was noted that Program clients may be reluctant to declare private plan insurance coverage for various reasons (e.g., view Program benefits as an inherent right, challenges to reinstate Program benefits once a private plan is declared). It is challenging to determine how, and to what extent, there are actual coordination issues with private insurance plans, versus a perception of these issues being at play.
In general, increased oversight of service providers by all plans is a direct result of cost containment efforts. Private and non-profit insurance plans emphasize retention, satisfaction, and market share. Public programs focus on utilization rates and financial measures. Health outcomes are becoming of interest to some non-profit plans.
The different objectives of private, non-profit, and public plans are reflected in the performance measures of interest. Private and non-profit health insurance plans emphasize retention, satisfaction and market share in their measures. Some plan representatives also mentioned financial measures and timeliness of service. Health outcomes are becoming of interest to some non-profit plans. Public programs focus on utilization rates and financial measures. In comparison, the NIHB Program tends to focus on various categories of benefit utilization expenditures (financial measures) and client safety.

Appendix 3 – Evaluation Description
Evaluation Scope
The scope of the evaluation included all the activities of Health Canada's First Nations and Inuit NIHB Program. NIHB Program benefits include: pharmacy, MS&E, dental care, vision care, STCIMHC, and MT to access medically required health services not available on-reserve or in the community of residence. The scope of the evaluation did not include any of the services provided by BC's FNHA in accordance with the British Columbia Tripartite Framework Agreement on First Nation Health Governance and sub-agreements, which will be evaluated separately. The period covered by the evaluation included activities from April 2011 to March 2016. Data collection, analysis and reporting activities spanned the period from March 2015 to June 2017.
Evaluation Issues
The specific questions used in this evaluation were based on five core issues. These are noted in Table 1 below. Corresponding to each of the core issues, evaluation questions were tailored to the program and guided the evaluation process.
Data Collection and Analysis Methods
The evaluation methodology was based on multiple lines of evidence. It included a literature, document, and administrative data review, a survey, key informant interviews, and a benchmarking study. Data were analyzed by triangulating information gathered through each of these methods. This included:
a systematic compilation, review and summarization of data to illustrate key findings;
a compilation and analysis of quantitative data obtained from the Program's databases, followed by validation from Program representatives; and,
a thematic analysis of qualitative data.
A summary of the data collection methodology and its intended contribution to the evaluation process is provided in the following sub-sections.
Literature, Document and Administrative Data Review
Method details:
Environmental scan of relevant sources linked to the Program area, together with a review of documents/files and databases provided by the Program and identified during the evaluation through other methods (e.g., key informant interviews).
Sources:
Scientific journals, grey literature, Treasury Board submissions, Memoranda to Cabinet, public opinion research reports, previous performance, evaluation and audit reports, policy documents, budget and expenditure information, performance measurement data reports, annual progress reports, grants and contributions files, financial and non-financial databases, and administrative records specific to the evaluation questions.
Intended use:
Provide background information on the history and objectives of the Program, as well as progress towards the achievement of intended outcomes.
Use as key source of qualitative and quantitative information.
Provide insights into any important shifts/changes that have occurred during the life of the Program.
Survey
Method details:
Self-administered, bilingual, web-based survey piloted prior to dissemination.
Survey guides tailored to Program clients.
Total responses: 27.
Target:
Program stakeholders (i.e., registered First Nations individuals and recognized Inuit residents in Canada receiving services from the NIHB Program).
Based on interest from regional Inuit organizations, the survey targeted Inuit residing in Nunavut, and Inuvialuit.
Responses: 19 surveys completed; 8 partials.
Intended use:
Assess client population perspectives on Program delivery.
Assist in further understanding the information gathered from other lines of evidence and provide additional context.
Key Informant Interviews
Method details:
