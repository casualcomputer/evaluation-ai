About the program
The Sectoral Initiatives Program was a Grants and Contributions program launched in 2013 to help key sectors of the Canadian economy identify, forecast, and address their human resources and skills shortage issues.
The Sectoral Initiatives Program funded national, partnership-based projects that:
developed and distributed sector-specific labour market intelligence, industry-driven national occupational standards, and skills certification and accreditation systems, and
developed innovative workforce solutions including those targeting underrepresented groups
From fiscal year 2017 to 2018 to fiscal year 2020 to 2021, the Program spent an average of $20.9 million annually and supported 90 projects in total.
Key findings
In fiscal year 2017 to 2018, the uptake of products and tools supported by the Sectoral Initiatives Program exceeded its overall target of 100,000 users. However, consistent tracking of this indicator ceased in fiscal year 2018 to 2019
Multiple lines of evidence suggest that the products and tools supported through the Program funding helped identify, forecast and address human resources and skills issues across a wide range of economic sectors
GBA+ considerations were integrated in the requirements and program selection criteria. While multiple lines of evidence demonstrated Program’s success in improving some equity considerations, these outcomes can be enhanced
Though the reporting requirements were streamlined for funding recipients, there is still a need for greater clarity on the reporting expectations and guidance on how to meet the requirements
Considerations
A better understanding of the overall program level outcomes could be achieved by improving the collection and tracking of end users’ data
Greater clarity on reporting expectations and technical support and guidance to funding recipients in meeting reporting requirements have potential to improve the reporting process
The program may enhance generating equitable outcomes by encouraging funding recipients to develop more specific products and tools in addressing the needs of underrepresented groups, sub-sectors and sub-regions
