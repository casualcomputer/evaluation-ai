Introduction
Program description
The Old Age  Security (OAS) program is the first pillar of Canada's retirement income  system. Program costs amounted to $51 billion in fiscal year 2017 to 2018,  including $500 million for the Allowances.
The OAS  program provides a basic pension upon which individuals may add income from  other sources, such as the Canada or Quebec Pension Plan (C/QPP), employer pension  plans and personal savings.
The OAS  program includes:
the OAS pension: a basic pension to nearly all seniors
the Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS): a supplement to low-income seniors
the Allowances:
        
Allowance (spousal Allowance): benefits to low-income near-seniors who are spouses of GIS  recipients
Allowance for the Survivor: benefits to low-income near-seniors who are widows or  widowers
Near-seniors  are defined in this evaluation as individuals who are 60 to 64 years old.
Evaluation context
The OAS evaluation was implemented in 2 phases.
Phase 1, completed in June 2018, focused on the labour market participation of OAS beneficiaries, the GIS top-up and service delivery. Key findings included the positive impact of the 2008 increase in the GIS earnings exemption (from $500 to $3,500) which:
raised employment rates among recipients of the Allowances by 1 percentage point
raised average employment income by 15% among working Allowances recipients
Phase 2 focuses on the Allowances and the deferral of the OAS pension:
the rationale for the Allowances and the characteristics of recipients are examined as part of the first evaluation of the Allowances in the last 25 years
the work and income profile of those deferring their pension, in addition to the incidence of deferral, provide the first assessment of deferral since its introduction in 2013
This evaluation supports efforts by the department to provide information to Canadians on deferral of the OAS pension and Canada Pension Plan (CPP) programs.
The Old Age Security  pension and the Guaranteed Income Supplement contribute to reducing poverty in  Canada
Recent  results indicate that:
the  OAS program contributed to reducing the percentage of seniors below Statistics  Canada's Low Income Cut-Off (LICO) to 4% in 2015. This rate would have been 19  percentage points higher without the program
OAS  benefits represented 23% of seniors' after-tax income on average in 2015. The  contribution of benefits to after-tax income of seniors varies by income group,  with benefits representing 65% of income for those in the lowest income  quintile and 8% of income for those in the highest income quintile
A previous  evaluation in 2012 also showed that the program contributes to reducing poverty  among seniors and that its benefits represent a significant proportion of  seniors' income.
Rationale for the  Allowances and profile of recipients
The Allowances were introduced to help alleviate financial  difficulties of near-senior spouses of seniors, and then extended to widows and  widowers.
1975: Introduction of the Allowance. 30% of married  women participated in the labour market in 1970.  Before the introduction of the Allowance, retirement of the husband led some  couples to live on a single OAS/GIS benefit, as only 1 spouse had the age  requirement to qualify for the OAS benefits.
1978: Extension of Allowance eligibility to widows  and widowers to include the 6-month period following the death of the OAS  pension recipient.
This was to  recognize the difficult circumstances some near-senior spouses could face when  their older spouse passes away (including losing their Allowance benefits and  the OAS benefits of their spouse).
1979: Extension of Allowance eligibility to widows  and widowers: 6-month limit was extended to continue until age 65 or  remarriage, whichever came first.
1985: Extension of the Allowance eligibility to  widows and widowers: Allowance for the Survivor was introduced for all  near-senior widows and widowers.
Parliament  raised concerns about the financial situation of many near-seniors,  particularly single women, but it was too costly to expand the eligibility of  the Allowance to all near-seniors.
Widows'  vulnerability was highlighted:
most  had been financial dependents for most of their lives
societal  norms encouraged them to perform only unpaid roles (mother, housekeeper,  community worker, etcetera)
many  would have difficulty finding paid work at the time
2019: The spousal Allowance was introduced in 1975.  Since that time, the participation rate of women in the labour market has  doubled (64% of married women participated in the labour market in 2018 versus  30% in 1970).  This trend is likely to continue.
Recipients  of the Allowances represent a small proportion of all near-seniors but a  significant share of near-senior widows and spouses of seniors.
In 2016,  recipients of the Allowances represented:
3%  of all near-seniors (78,810 recipients)
22%  of near-senior widows or widowers (24,900 recipients)
13%  of near-senior spouses of seniors (53,910 recipients)
These  proportions have been decreasing, as income among near-seniors has increased.

80% of near-senior spouses of seniors and widows/widowers are women, half were working in 2016.
Most recipients of the Allowances had very low incomes, low levels of education, and were women.
Income distribution of recipients of the Allowance for the Survivor in 2016:
44% of recipients had income below $18,000
29% had income between $18,000 and $25,000
27% had income above $25,000
Since 1998,  the average real income of recipients has increased (from $20,000 in 1998 to $24,000 in 2016)
Income distribution of recipients of the Allowance (spousal) in 2016:
41% of recipients had family income below $30,000
33% had family income between $30,000 and $40,000
25% had family income above $40,000
Since 1998, the average real family income of recipients has increased (from $33,000 in 1998 to $37,000 in 2016)
Gender of recipients of the Allowance for the Survivor in 2016:
87% of recipients were women
Gender of recipients of the Allowance (spousal) in 2016:
89% of recipients were women
Education of recipients of the Allowance for the Survivor in 2016:
41% of recipients had less than a high school  degree
30% with only a high school degree
29% with other degrees
Education of  recipients of the Allowance (spousal) in 2016:
37% of recipients had less than a high school  degree
32% had only a high school degree
30% had other degrees
Due to the  lack of 2016 data for the Market Basket Measure at the time of analysis (early  2018), 2016 before-tax LICO was used to present the incidence of low income.
Allowance  for the Survivor benefits account for a significant share of the income of most  recipients.
In 2016,  Allowance for the Survivor recipients with income below $18,000 relied mainly  on Allowance benefits (representing 60% of income for the average recipient)  and C/QPP benefits (35%) as their sources of income.
For  recipients with income between $18,000 and $25,000, Allowance and C/QPP  benefits represented together about 70% of their income, both with similar  amounts.
For recipients  with income above $25,000, Allowance benefits represented about 20% of their  income.

Note: Other income includes Registered  Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP) withdrawals, employment income, other pension  income (private pensions, annuities, Pooled Registered Pension Plans and  Registered Retirement Income Funds withdrawals), and income from other sources.
The impact of the Allowance for the Survivor: benefits reduced the proportion under the  after-tax LICO by 27 percentage points (from 53% to 26% of recipients) in 2011.
Allowance (spousal) and other OAS benefits account for a significant share of the family  income of most recipients.
In 2016, recipients with family income under $30,000 relied mainly on OAS benefits  (representing 75% of family income for the average recipient), including about  a quarter of their income coming from Allowance benefits.
For  beneficiaries with family income between $30,000 and $40,000, Allowance  benefits represented about 15% of their income, with 45% of their income coming  from OAS benefits (including the Allowance).
For beneficiaries  with family income over $40,000, Allowance benefits represented only about 5%  of their income.

Note: Other income includes RRSP withdrawals,  employment income, other pension income (private pensions, annuities, Pooled  Registered Pension Plans and Registered Retirement Income Funds withdrawals),  and other individual or spousal income (excluding spousal OAS/GIS).
The impact of  the Allowance: benefits reduced the proportion of recipients under the  after-tax LICO by 11 percentage points (from 15% to 4% of recipients) in 2011.
Most  recipients of the Allowances did not have a significant attachment to the  labour market, even at age 58 or 59.
A  quarter of all the recipients of the Allowances worked in 2016
Half  of the recipients of the Allowances worked when they were 58 or 59 years  old
Even  among those who worked, employment income was already very limited at that age  for most

The  majority of low-income near-seniors are not eligible for the Allowances due to  their marital status or the age of their spouse.
In 2016,  600,000 near-seniors (or 27%) had income below the Allowances income qualifying  thresholds.
About  450,000 (or 75%) of these individuals were near-seniors who did not have the  marital status to qualify for the Allowances (they were not widowed or their  spouse was younger than 65 years old).
275,000 (or 45%) of these near-seniors were single and not widowed, half of which were  women.
180,000 (or 30%) of these were near-seniors with spouses younger than 65 years old, a  third of which were women.
Low-income  non-widowed single near-seniors had lower income, on average, than recipients  of the Allowance for the Survivor.
Over two-thirds of low-income non-widowed single near-seniors had income below  $18,000.
These individuals' income was lower on average than the ones for the Allowance for  the Survivor recipients, mainly because they did not receive the Allowance  benefits.
This was the case for both women and men.
Source: 10%  sample of T1 file from the Canada Revenue Agency.
Note: All single near-seniors include widowed,  divorced, separated or never married.
*The table only includes near-seniors with  income below the Allowance for the Survivor threshold.
The marital  status requirement of the Allowance for the Survivor was challenged in Federal  Court. The court ruled that the Charter of Rights does not require public  pensions to provide the same benefits to everyone.
Low-income  near-seniors with a spouse younger than 65 had lower income, on average, than  recipients of the Allowance.
Half of  low-income near-seniors with spouses younger than 65 had family income below  $30,000.
These  near-seniors' family income was lower than the ones of the recipients of the  Allowance, mainly because they did not receive Allowance benefits.
Source: 10% sample of T1 file from the Canada Revenue Agency.
Note: Married near-seniors include those in a  common-law relationship. All married near-seniors include those whose spouse is  a senior (65+) and those whose spouse is younger than 65.
**The table only includes near-seniors with  income below the Allowance threshold.
Even with a  similar financial situation, all near-seniors do not receive the same financial  support from the federal government as recipients of the Allowances do.  However, individuals in this age group may be eligible for provincial or  territorial assistance.
Conclusions on the  Allowances
The Allowances are important for low-income near-seniors. Most recipients have very  low income and benefits represent a significant proportion of their income.
Most recipients of the Allowances continue to be predominantly women, most have low  levels of education and most had limited attachment to the labour market already  at 58 and 59 years old.
The limited attachment to the labour market of married women was central to the rationale  for introducing the Allowances. Social changes since the 1970s have been  significant but challenges remain for many near-seniors.
There are also many vulnerable individuals among other single near-seniors and other  near-senior couples whose marital status makes them ineligible for the  Allowances.
Even with similar financial situations to recipients of the Allowances, they do not  receive the same financial support from the federal government as recipients of  the Allowances. However, individuals in this age group may be eligible for  provincial or territorial assistance.
Recommendation
The department  should take into account the evaluation findings to inform its analysis on the  Allowances.
Deferral of the Old Age  Security pension
Since 2013,  seniors have the option to defer the start of their OAS pension by up to 5 years  in exchange for a higher monthly payment.
The monthly  OAS pension amount is increased by 0.6% for every month the OAS pension is  deferred, up to a maximum of 36% (for delaying for 5 years), in addition  to regular indexation of OAS benefits. The deferred pension amount is  calculated on an actuarially neutral basis.
There are  data lags when assessing the characteristics of those who defer their OAS  pension.
There  is a 5-year data lag to identify all individuals that deferred in a cohort that  reaches 65 years old. The data on the deferral decision is available only  once the person starts receiving their OAS pension (or once their application  is processed)
Complete  data on the first cohort of seniors who could have deferred for up to 5 years  was available at the end of 2018. Partial data is available for younger cohorts
There is a  limited number of seniors deferring their OAS pension, but it is rising.
In 2018,  60,000 seniors received a deferred OAS pension, up from 3,500 in 2014 and  30,000 in 2016.
Figure 5: Number of seniors receiving a  deferred OAS pension (2014 to 2018)


Text description of Figure 5


Source: 10%  sample of linked T1 and OAS administrative data.
4% of  seniors in the first eligible cohort chose to defer their OAS pension (Employment  and Social Development Canada [ESDC], 2019b). This is in line with projections  from the Chief Actuary.
One of the  reasons few people choose to defer their OAS pension is awareness. A 2018 departmental  online survey found that awareness of OAS deferral was low, with 25% of 60 to 64-year-old  respondents aware they could defer their OAS pension.
The length  of deferral chosen varies among individuals.
Among  seniors who deferred their OAS pension, the length of deferral was 23 months on  average.
A third of  seniors deferring did so for a year or less and over 60% for 2 years or  less. Another 20% deferred for 2 to 3 years, while the remaining 20%  deferred for more than 3 years.

Note: The 2013 cohort is the first  cohort eligible for deferral. It includes only people reaching 65 years  old in June to August 2013, due to data availability.
About 9% of  those who deferred received the GIS in 2018. The average length of deferral was  17 months among GIS recipients.
Most  seniors worked during deferral and most had high income.
About 80%  worked during deferral among the first 2013 cohort of seniors deferring.  This is much higher than among OAS recipients of this cohort, among which the proportion  working varied from 30% to 40%.

During  deferral, the average individual income of these seniors was about $100,000  from 2013 to 2016, which is more than twice as much as among OAS recipients of  this cohort.

Note: The 2013 cohort is the first  cohort eligible for deferral. It includes only people reaching 65 years  old in June to August 2013, due to data availability.
A similar  pattern is present for family income, with the average during deferral almost  twice as high as among OAS pension recipients of this cohort.
Many  seniors deferring would have paid the OAS recovery tax if they had received the  OAS pension.
Nearly 60%  of those deferring had income over $75,000 in 2013 to 2015, so they would have  paid the OAS recovery tax if they had received the OAS pension. Over 30% of  those deferring had income over $120,000 in 2013 to 2015, so they would have  completely repaid their OAS pension through the OAS recovery tax if they had  received the OAS pension in those years.
There are  seniors deferring their OAS pension in all income groups.

The 2013 cohort is the first cohort eligible  for deferral in 2013.  It includes only  people reaching 65 years old in June to August 2013, due to data availability.
Even after  deferral, seniors are more likely to work and to have high family income.
Among  seniors who deferred their OAS pension for up to 2 years in the 2013  cohort:
46%  worked in 2016 (when they reached 68 years of age)
average  income was $65,000, with family income averaging $110,000 in 2016
In  comparison, among all OAS recipients of the same cohort:
28%  worked in 2016
average  income was $45,000 and average family income was $75,000 in 2016
There were  people receiving a deferred OAS pension in all income groups.
Conclusions on Old Age Security deferral
Most seniors worked during deferral.
Most of those deferring had high income. However, there were seniors deferring their OAS pension in all income groups.
Awareness of OAS pension deferral is low, as is the proportion of seniors who chose to defer. About a quarter of 60 to 64-year-olds are aware of this possibility and  4% of the first cohort of eligible seniors chose to defer.
Raising awareness on deferral will help Canadians make better retirement planning  decisions, including whether to continue working.
Recommendation
The department should continue to promote awareness of OAS pension deferral.
Management response and action plan
Overall management response
The evaluation is integral to ensuring that the OAS program remains relevant and continues to meet its objectives.
The department agrees with all of the report's recommendations and is pleased to present the following management response.
Recommendation 1
The department  should take into account the evaluation findings to inform its analysis on the Allowances.
Management response
The department  agrees with this recommendation and welcomes the new data the evaluation  provides.
Historically,  the Allowances were designed to:
recognize  the difficult circumstances that low-income couples face when living on only 1 pension until the other spouse becomes eligible, at age 65, for the OAS pension  and the GIS (the Allowance); and
assist  60 to 64-year-old widows or widowers who are facing financial difficulties and  have not remarried or become the common-law partner of another person (the  Allowance for the Survivor)
The OAS program is part of an extensive network of income security programs in Canada.
Generally, income security for low-income persons under the age of 65 is a  provincial/territorial responsibility. There are various provincial/territorial  programs in place to help people navigate through financially difficult periods  in their lives.
While the evaluation has shown that other 60 to 64-year-old low-income individuals are  not eligible for the Allowances, low-income individuals in this age group, such  as single, separated or divorced individuals, who face financial hardship and  meet the eligibility requirements may be able to receive social assistance from  their province or territory of residence.
Furthermore, individuals who have contributed to the CPP or the Quebec Pension Plan are  eligible to start receiving benefits at age 60.
Management action plan
1.1 No additional action required.
Completion date: completed.
Recommendation 2
The department  should continue to promote awareness of OAS pension deferral.
Management response
The department  agrees with this recommendation.
To measure  awareness about pension deferral provisions, the department undertook an online  survey in 2018, recruiting respondents among visitors, aged 40 to 64, to the canada.ca  website.
The survey  showed that awareness of the OAS pension deferral option was low, with only 17%  of respondents aware that they could defer their OAS pension for up to 5 years,  from age 65 to 70. Awareness was found to increase with age, income,  education, and financial literacy. In addition, women had slightly lower  awareness rates than men.
The department  identified a series of actions to increase Canadians' awareness of the OAS  deferral option and to ensure that Canadians have access to information about  OAS deferral.
Several of  these activities are already underway and include:
using  ESDC's social media channels to raise awareness, as well as publicly releasing  the results of ESDC's online survey
disseminating  articles on pension deferral in publications or websites targeting near-retirees
reviewing  Government information such as ESDC's website, the OAS/GIS automatic enrolment  letter and application form, and community outreach material
The department  will continue its ongoing activities aimed at increasing awareness about OAS  deferral and explore options to monitor the reach of its activities.
Management action plan
2.1 Public release of the ESDC deferral survey – Income Security and  Social Development branch (ISSD) / Public Affairs and Stakeholder Relations Branch (PASRB).
Completion date: March 2020.
2.2 Raise awareness on ESDC's social media channels – ISSD / PASRB.
Completion date: June 2020.
2.3 Disseminate articles on deferral – ISSD / PASRB.
Completion date: June 2020.
2.4 Review Government information – ISSD / Transformation and Integrated  Service Management Branch / Citizen Service Branch / PASRB.
Completion  date: December 2020.
Annex 1: Old Age  Security program description
Old Age Security pension
Description
In January  2019, the OAS pension provided benefits to 6.3 million seniors with the  full basic pension amounting to $601.45 per month (or about $7,200 per year). All  benefits under the OAS program are indexed quarterly.
The OAS recovery  tax, which is part of the Income Tax Act,  requires all higher-income pensioners to repay part, or all, of their OAS  pension if their individual income exceeds a threshold. For the 2018 tax year,  seniors must repay $0.15 for every dollar of income exceeding $75,910. Benefits  are completely repaid when income reaches $123,386 (for those not receiving a  deferred OAS pension).
Eligibility requirements
To qualify,  a person living in Canada at the time of application must be 65 years or older and have resided in Canada for at least 10 years after age 18.
The full  basic OAS pension is payable to seniors who have resided in Canada for at least 40 years after age 18.
A partial  pension is paid to seniors who have lived in Canada for at least 10 years after age 18, and their benefits are prorated at the rate of one fortieth of the full pension for each  complete year of residence.
Guaranteed Income Supplement
Description
In January  2019,GIS benefits were paid to 2 million low-income seniors and could reach $898.32 per month for single seniors and $540.77 per month for seniors  who were married or in a common-law relationship (or up to about $10,800 or  $6,500 per year respectively).
Eligibility requirements
In order to  be eligible for the GIS, a person must receive the OAS pension, be a legal resident of Canada and have income, or combined income for couples, below the  maximum annual thresholds.
Single seniors qualified for the GIS with incomes up to $18,240 per year and up to $24,096 for senior couples in January 2019.
The Allowances:  Allowance (spousal) and the Allowance for the Survivor
Description
In January  2019, the Allowance was paid to 51,000 people and the Allowance for the  Survivor to 22,000 people. Benefits can reach $1,142.22 per month for the  Allowance and $1,361.56 per month for the Allowance for the Survivor (or about  $13,700 and $16,300 per year respectively, based on January 2019 rates).
Eligibility requirements
In order to  qualify for the Allowances, a person must be 60 to 64 years old, be a  legal resident of Canada and have resided in Canada for at least 10 years  after the age of 18.
In  addition, a person must be a low-income widow or widower to qualify for the  Allowance for the Survivor, or the spouse or common-law partner of a recipient  of the GIS to qualify for the Allowance.
Annex 2: Key findings of  phase 1 of the evaluation
Many factors contributed to the increase in the employment rate of seniors and  near-seniors, including among OAS beneficiaries, notably growth in the service  sector, technological advances and improved health levels. The increase in the  GIS earnings exemption in 2008 increased employment rates among recipients of  the Allowances by 1 percentage point and increased average employment income  among working GIS and Allowances recipients.
The GIS top-up reached many groups of vulnerable seniors, as did other OAS benefits. For  the average top-up recipient, the top-up represented 4% of OAS benefits and was  equivalent to 10% of their other sources of income.
With population aging and increases in the number of OAS beneficiaries, total  administrative costs of the OAS program have increased from $118 million  in fiscal year 2007 to 2008 to $177 million in fiscal year 2016 to 2017. Administrative  costs represented about 0.4% of program costs throughout this period.
Some of the  most relevant indicators of service delivery quality are monitored closely by  the department; notably, access to Service Canada agents, timeliness of benefit  receipt, take‑up and payment accuracy.
However, the client satisfaction survey conducted on behalf of Service Canada was  discontinued in 2010, leading to an important knowledge gap since then.
Recommendation
Consider regularly monitoring client satisfaction with OAS service delivery, including monitoring client satisfaction of the various service delivery channels.

Annex 4: Limitations and  summary of studies to support phase 2 of the evaluation
Technical study: ESDC  (2019a), "Recipients of the Allowances Program: a Historical Perspective"
Description:
This report  uses T1 data from the Canada Revenue Agency. Its purpose was to examine the  characteristics of the recipients of the Allowances, how their profile has  changed over time, the rationale behind the introduction of the Allowances in  the 1970s, and whether the Allowances continue to address a demonstrable need  today. Additionally, this report illustrates the characteristics of other low-income near-seniors who are not eligible for the Allowances.
Limitations:
Reliable  data on the characteristics of recipients of the Allowances was only available  back to 1998. Ideally, comparison to Allowance recipients back to 1975 would  have been useful to examine changes to beneficiaries since the introduction of  the program.
Technical study: ESDC  (2019b), "Who Defers the Start of their OAS pension?"
Description:
This paper uses linked administrative data from the Canada Revenue Agency (T1) and the OAS  program. The report examines to what extent the department can monitor the characteristics  of seniors deferring their OAS pension. It also provides a profile of  individuals who defer the start of their OAS pension and illustrates the extent  to which seniors are deferring their OAS pension.
Limitations:
Complete  data on OAS deferral of each cohort of 65year-olds is only available with a  5-year delay. Therefore, most of the analysis had to be based on the cohort who  reached 65 years old in 2013.
It was not  possible to find a methodology to measure the impact of OAS deferral on the employment  rates of seniors. No appropriate control group could be found. The report  shows, however, that employment rates are high while seniors are deferring  their OAS pension.
Technical study: ESDC (2016b), "Participation in the Old Age Security Program – National Household  Survey"
Description:
This report  uses data from the National Household Survey. The report examines participation  in the OAS program, take-up rates among different sub-groups of the population,  and presents a financial profile of beneficiaries of the Allowances. These  findings help to show how the Allowances continue to address a demonstrable  need.
Limitations:
The report  uses older data from 2011.
