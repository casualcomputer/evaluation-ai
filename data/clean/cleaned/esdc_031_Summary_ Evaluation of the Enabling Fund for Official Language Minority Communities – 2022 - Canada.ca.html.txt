Program objectives
The Enabling Fund aims to enhance the development and vitality of Official Language Minority Communities by strengthening their capacity in the areas of human resources and community economic development, and by promoting partnerships at all levels, including federal partners.
The Enabling Fund is a component of the Government of Canada’s strategy for official languages as expressed in the Action Plan for Official Languages – 2018 to 2023: Investing in Our Future.
The Enabling Fund investment
The Enabling Fund represents a total investment of $80.4M over 5 years. An annual budget of $13M is allocated through contribution agreements to 14 non-profit organizations (one national organization and one organization in each province and territory).
Evaluation methodology

key informant interviews with 17 leaders and staff members of the 5 organizations; and 
a review of 80 documents (contribution agreements, quarterly reports, and annual reports) provided by 5 organizations between April 2018 and March 2020
