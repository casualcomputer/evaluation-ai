Source: Strategic and Service Policy Branch Evaluation Directorate
Labour Market Development Agreements:
ESDC invests $2.14B annually to help unemployed EI eligible Canadians find and maintain employment.
The Employment Benefits and Support Measures are designed and delivered by provinces and territories.
Programs and services examined include Skills Development, Skills Development-Apprentices, Targeted Wage Subsidies, Job Creation Partnerships and Employment Assistance Services.
The four key evaluation results:
Improved the labour market attachment of participants in general (compared to non-participants)
Reduced dependence on employment insurance and social assistance
Providing employment assistance services early during unemployment produced larger impacts
Social benefits of participation exceeded costs of investments for most interventions
Non experimental approach to estimating incremental impacts on earnings
Incremental Impact (Change due to program participation)
: + $3,000 (in other words, $8,000 - $5,000)
Total expenditures and number of interventions for 2014/2015 by province and territory
Moving forward will help focus interventions based on what works best.
