About the program
The Canada Student Loans Program  provides financial assistance to students to help them access and afford  post-secondary education. In 2018 to 2019, the program provided $5.2 billion in  student loans and grants to close to 700,000 students.
Key findings
The findings outlined the importance of the  Program in facilitating access to post-secondary education and helping students  persist during their studies and graduate.
Without the federal portion of their student  loans and grants:

many (41%) program participants indicated that  they would have delayed their studies, while some (13%) indicated they would  not have pursued any post-secondary studies 
many (39%) indicated they would not have  enrolled in the same program

Most (83%) program participants completed a  post-secondary program
Among borrowers who completed their program, many  (36%) indicated that they would not have persisted during their studies and  graduated, without the federal portion of their student loans and grants
Half of those who dropped out of their program  before completion did so for financial reasons. They indicated they would have  continued their studies with a larger student loan
Program participants had limited understanding  of how their student loans and grants were determined and of the different  features of the Program
Recommendations
Examine student financial need with a view to  identify funding gaps faced by students
Further enhance awareness and understanding of  the program among Canada Student Grant and Loan recipients
