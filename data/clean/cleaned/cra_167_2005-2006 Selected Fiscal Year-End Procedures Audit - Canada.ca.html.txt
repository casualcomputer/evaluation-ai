Conclusion
Executive Summary
Background:
The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) prepares annual Administered Activities Financial Statements for the reporting of tax revenues using full accrual accounting. As in prior years, the Finance and Administration Branch (F&A) requested Internal Audit Division's (IAD) assistance in providing assurance to management on the accuracy and completeness of selected financial information to be reported in these statements.
The work was carried out in conjunction with the annual audit of the financial statements conducted by the Office of the Auditor General (OAG) who is responsible for issuing an audit opinion on their fair presentation. IAD efforts were focused on four areas that were considered at risk for the 2005-2006 fiscal year. The audit approach and methodology for the year-end work was discussed with F&A and the OAG and the IAD results have been used by the OAG in formulating its opinion on the CRA Administered Activities Financial Statements.
Objective:
The objective of the audit was to provide assurance to management on the completeness and accuracy of selected cash and Revenue Ledger (RL) procedures and account information and the adequacy of procedures used in estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts (ADA). The scope of the audit did not include the verification of amounts that would appear in the financial statements, but focused on risks that had direct implications on the:
accuracy and completeness of the newly automated year-end trial balance procedures implemented in the Revenue Ledger (RL);
accuracy and completeness of the separation of the CRA and Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) accounts in the RL;
adequacy of the procedures applied in determining the proportion of uncollectable accounts receivable (ADA rates); and
accuracy of the allocation of cash to the proper fiscal year
The audit took place between February and September 2006 and was conducted in accordance with the
International Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing.
Conclusion:
Overall, the financial reporting procedures and information relating to the areas examined by IAD were found to be accurate and complete in all material respects. However, further management action is needed with respect to completing the separation of the CRA and CBSA RL accounts and some procedural issues have to be addressed with regard to the review process used in estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts (ADA).
Action Plans:
CBSA is working towards creating its own RL by December 2007, which would allow for the complete separation of the RL accounts. A working group with representatives from F&A, Tax Services and Debt Management Branch (TSDMB), the Department of Finance and Treasury Board was also set up in September 2006 to discuss ways in which the ADA procedures can be streamlined for the 2006-2007 fiscal year-end processes.
Introduction
The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) prepares annual Administered Activities Financial Statements for the reporting of tax revenue using full accrual accounting. The Office of the Auditor General (OAG) audits these statements and is responsible for issuing an opinion on their fair presentation each year.
As in prior years, the Finance and Administration Branch (F&A) requested the assistance of the Internal Audit Division (IAD) of the Corporate Audit and Evaluation Branch (CAEB) in providing assurance to management on the accuracy and completeness of selected financial information to be reported in these statements. The audit work focused on areas that were considered at risk for the 2005-2006 fiscal year.
The audit approach and methodology for the year-end work was discussed with F&A and the OAG and results of the IAD work have been used by the OAG in the formulation of its opinion on the CRA's Administered Activities Financial Statements.
Focus of the Audit
The objective of the audit was to provide assurance to management on the completeness and accuracy of selected cash and Revenue Ledger (RL) procedures and account information and adequacy of procedures used in estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts (ADA). The scope of the audit did not include the verification of amounts that would appear in the financial statements, but focused on risks that had direct implications on the:
accuracy and completeness of the newly automated year-end trial balance procedures implemented in the Revenue Ledger (RL);
accuracy and completeness of the separation of the CRA and Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) accounts in the RL;
adequacy of the procedures applied in determining the proportion of uncollectable accounts receivable (ADA rates); and
accuracy of the allocation of cash to the proper fiscal year
The audit took place between February and September 2006. Audit work included the review and analysis of sample transactions, examination of the CRA and CBSA account listings in RL, and the review of quality control procedures established to ensure the accuracy of the information used in determining the allowance for doubtful accounts (ADA).
The audit was conducted in accordance with the
International Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing.
Findings, Recommendations and Action Plans
1.0 Automation of the Trial Balance in the Revenue Ledger (RL)
The trial balance used by F&A as the basis for the preparation of the administered financial statements has in the past been generated manually using a spreadsheet. Effective April 1, 2006, F&A introduced automated procedures for preparing this year-end trial balance within RL itself.
IAD reviewed the new automated procedures used for posting the accrual and adjustment entries into RL and confirmed the accuracy of the postings. The automation did not extend to the actual determination of the entries and for that reason these manual processes did not fall within the scope of this audit.
Further details are provided in Table 1 below regarding the key risks considered in reviewing the new RL automated procedures, audit testing carried out and the results.

2.0 Separation of the CRA and CBSA Accounts in the RL
CRA and the CBSA became separate organizations in 2004 but they have continued to share accounts for recording of revenues in the RL. Financial reporting for both organizations has become time-consuming and complex under this arrangement. Efforts were made in 2005-2006 to separate the shared accounts to the extent practical given the technical limitations of having to still share the Revenue Ledger system.
At the time the audit began, F&A indicated that the separation had not been completed for 24 RL accounts as CRA and CBSA still share the same client Department Number (122) for reporting cash and interdepartmental settlements to Public Works and Government Services Canada (PWGSC).
IAD confirmed that work on separating the CRA and CBSA accounts in RL had been undertaken. However, further work is still required to complete the process and manual entries were used to separate transactions in preparing the trial balances again this year. Complete separation will be dependent upon CBSA implementing its own accounting system.
Further details are provided in Table 2 below regarding key risks considered in reviewing CRA and CBSA accounts in the RL, audit testing carried out and the results.
Table 2 – CRA and CBSA Shared RL Accounts
Recommendation
F & A should work with CBSA to develop a comprehensive plan to complete the remaining separation of shared RL accounts.
Action Plan
CBSA is working on a Business Case and Feasibility Analysis in an effort to establish their own Revenue Ledger (RL). A comprehensive plan is to be developed once CBSA senior management has reviewed the Business Case, and a decision is made as to the approach for the split. CBSA continues to work towards December 31, 2007 as the implementation date and CRA will continue to monitor the progress of this initiative.
3.0 Allowance for Doubtful Accounts (ADA)
The allowance for doubtful accounts is established to indicate management's best estimate of the collectability of amounts assessed but not yet paid. The ADA is calculated by CRA on the basis of an annual evaluation of the collectability of a sample of accounts receivable by experienced collections personnel (ADA analysts).
The F&A Branch requested an increase in the sample size for this year to provide added precision in establishing ADA estimates within each revenue stream. Regional ADA analysts under the direction of the Tax Services and Debt Management Branch (TSDM) conducted the sample review at three CRA locations. Account review procedures and guidelines as well as an MS Access software program were developed for use by the field officers to ensure consistency in evaluating the collectability of the accounts receivable. The software program required officers to follow a prescribed approach in evaluating each account.
After the initial evaluation of the accounts was completed, concerns were raised about a possible understatement of the ADA because of an unintentional bias in the results. For that reason a secondary review of the same sample of accounts was undertaken. This resulted in an increase in the ADA estimate and this final amount was subsequently accepted by the OAG. The decision to carry out additional work this year serves to underscore an inherent risk associated with the current methodology (using sampling) in terms of producing inconsistent results.
Further details are provided in Table 3 below regarding the key risks considered in reviewing the ADA review process, the audit testing carried out and the results.
Table 3 – Allowance for Doubtful Accounts (ADA)
Recommendation
TSDM and F&A should work together to review the approach and methodology used in establishing the ADA estimates and make adjustments as needed before the 2006-2007 ADA evaluation to minimize the risk of a bias in the results.
Action Plan
TSDM and F&A are now part of a working group with representatives from the Department of Finance and the Treasury Board set up in September 2006 to discuss ways in which the ADA process can be streamlined for 2006-2007 and beyond.
Although the methodology currently used to determine the allowance for doubtful accounts is consistent with generally accepted accounting principles, it is CRA management's view that there may be other methodologies that are also consistent with these principles that would yield better results. It is their intention to explore any promising avenue for improvement of the determination of the allowance for the coming year-end and not limit themselves to preserving the current approach.
4.0 Allocation of Cash Receipts
The allocation of cash to the proper fiscal year is an important element in determining the amount of cash reported on the Administered Activities Financial Statements. Also considered for this is cash on hand, which represents cash receipts received in the old fiscal year but deposited in the new fiscal year.
IAD concluded that the accuracy of the received date recorded in the client accounting systems and the methodology used by F&A to determine cash on hand were adequate for the purpose of allocating cash receipts to the proper fiscal year within the materiality threshold established for the audit.
Further details are provided in Table 4 below regarding the key risks considered in reviewing the allocation of cash procedures, the audit testing carried out and the results.
Table 4 – Allocation of Cash
Follow Up of 2004-2005 Fiscal Year-End Audit
IAD followed up on findings in the previous fiscal year-end audit to determine the status of management actions plans. The two areas in which recommendations had been made included the allocation of cash receipts and the allowance for doubtful accounts and action taken to address the issues identified can be found in the sections of this report relating to these areas.
Conclusion
Overall, the financial reporting procedures and information relating to the areas examined by IAD were found to be accurate and complete in all material respects. However, further management action is needed with respect to completing the separation of the CRA and CBSA RL accounts and some procedural issues have to be addressed with regard to the review process used in estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts (ADA). CBSA is working towards creating its own RL by December 2007, which would allow for the complete separation of the RL accounts. A working group with representatives from F&A, Tax Services and Debt Management Branch (TSDMB), the Department of Finance and Treasury Board was also set up in September 2006 to discuss ways in which the ADA procedures can be streamlined for the 2006-2007 fiscal year-end processes.
