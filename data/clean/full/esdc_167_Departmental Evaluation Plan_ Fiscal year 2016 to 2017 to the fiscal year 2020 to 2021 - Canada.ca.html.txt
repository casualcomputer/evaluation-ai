Deputy  head’s confirmation note
I  am pleased to submit the approved Employment and Social Development Canada  (ESDC) Departmental Evaluation Plan for fiscal years 2016-17 to 2020-21 to the  Treasury Board, as required by the Policy  on Evaluation.
As per Sections 6.1.7 and 6.1.8 of the Policy, I confirm that this five-year Plan:
Includes evaluation coverage of all ongoing direct program  spending;
Includes all ongoing programs of grants and contributions  administered by the department, as required by section 42.1 of the Financial Administration Act (FAA);
Includes all administrative aspects of major statutory  spending;
Aligns with and supports the departmental Management,  Resources and Results Structures; and
Has been designed to help support the requirements of the  Expenditure Management System, including strategic reviews.
I will ensure that this Plan is updated annually, and I will  provide information about its implementation to the Treasury Board of Canada  Secretariat, as required.
Executive summary
The Department of Employment and Social Development  Canada delivers  approximately $122.2 billion annually in services and programs such as  Employment Insurance, Aboriginal Skills and Employment Training Strategy, Old Age Security Programs and  other statutory transfer payment programs that profoundly impact the lives of Canadians. The role of the Evaluation Directorate is to provide ESDC decision-makers  with evaluation results  that empower: timely and relevant information they can rely on for  policy development and spending decisions.
According  to the mandate of the three ESDC ministers, all work must be grounded in  performance measurement, evidence, and feedback from Canadians. The Treasury  Board Secretariat has also been mandated a strengthened culture of measurement,  evaluation, and innovation in program and policy design and service delivery,  characterized by improved use of evidence and data in program innovation and  evaluation.
The  Evaluation Directorate recognizes and welcomes the pivotal role it can play in  the realization of these mandates. In addition, the Directorate has focused  resources to ensure that evaluation reports emphasize delivery and results.  This allows the Department to determine where and when resources can be most effective  in delivering programs.
This document presents 59 evaluation  projects  that the Evaluation Directorate will be conducting from 2016-17 to 2020-21.
The Plan is based on its initial budget of $6.48M for  2016-17, a budget that recognizes the need for timely and relevant results in  the context of value for money, as determined by the programs’ relevance and  performance. As proof of the Directorate’s commitment to implementing  cost-effective methods, this Plan features more efficient evaluation strategies  such as  a streamlined process for assessing Labour Market  Information Agreements, and a reduced overall reliance on professional services  spending when cost-effective.
The Plan  provides information on evaluation status and coverage for projects required by  legislation, as well as for major statutory programs such as Employment Insurance and Canada Pension Plan programs that  address social and economic issues supporting the Government’s policy agenda. It also reports on the Evaluation Directorate’s  enabling activities - such as advising on privacy and performance measurement - as well as developing its own expanded  performance measurement strategy focused on collaborating, innovating,  streamlining and strategizing.
One  of the main challenges that the Directorate faces, is incomplete performance  measurement information for some programs, which is necessary for high quality  evaluation reports. Multiple initiatives have been introduced to manage this  challenge, such as investing more in the planning and pre-evaluation stages,  developing evaluation strategies, and engaging more in developing performance  measurement strategies.
Additionally, the Directorate is mitigating a  risk to ensure evaluation coverage on all ongoing direct program spending,  including the administrative aspects of major statutory programs, by developing  a proposal in consultation with key stakeholders to evaluate three Service  Canada delivery channels (telephone, in-person and internet).
Achievements  by the Directorate in 2015-16 include:
Completing seven evaluation reports;
Providing performance measurement advice to over 35 programs  and initiatives;
Disseminating knowledge through presentations at the 2015 Canadian Evaluation Society conference  and sharing technical studies with provinces and territories;
Seeking input from clients using  surveys (e.g., Post-Evaluation Survey);
Using software technologies such as  SharePoint and the Planning and Reporting on Evaluation Projects (PREP)  database to facilitate engagement and dissemination of information across ESDC;
Developing a web analytics methodology for the evaluation of  Learning and Labour Market Information;
Demonstrating leadership in the evaluation community by  participating in a pilot project to develop common indicators for evaluating  social outcomes and impacts;
Conducting more work in-house in support of the Federal  Government’s priority to reduce spending on external consultants.
This  Plan demonstrates that the Evaluation Directorate is fulfilling its own mandate  of providing “results that empower,” while seeking to expand on the value it  can provide to: ESDC’s  management team; portfolio ministers and parliamentarians; provinces, territories and third party  organizations;  and by strategic  program, operational policy developers and central agencies.

1. Planning environment
1.1 Government and departmental priorities
As the fourth largest federal department, ESDC oversees  three business lines: Employment  and Social Development, the Labour Program and Service Canada. ESDC is responsible for developing, managing and  delivering social, labour market and economic programs and services. How these  programs and services are implemented and delivered is critical to the  Department’s success in becoming a higher-performing organization that provides  quality service and value for money.
ESDC’s priorities must respond to align with the needs of  Canadians. The three ESDC ministers have been asked by the Prime Minister to  respond to emerging priorities and seek input from stakeholders in policy and  program development. By collaborating, innovating,  streamlining and strategizing, the Evaluation  Directorate will deliver results that empower their efforts
Footnote

to ensure:
Work is informed by performance measurement,  evidence and feedback from Canadians;
Effective measures are developed to assess the  impact of the organization;
New performance standards are established to  better serve Canadians; and
Resources are directed to those initiatives  having the greatest positive impact on the lives of Canadians.
The Directorate produces evaluations which surpass policy  requirements to assess programs related to important social and economic issues  on the Government of Canada’s policy agenda (e.g., Employment Insurance, Canada  Pension Plan, Third Party Leadership Social Pilot Project), as well as other  internal departmental initiatives such as the Evaluation of the Group Mentoring  Pilot. Accordingly, the Evaluation Directorate invests resources and effort to  determine whether Canadians are receiving value for money and meeting the needs  of Parliamentarians, senior management and citizens with information about  major statutory programs for decision-making and accountability purposes.
The Evaluation Directorate is also making progress toward  the achievement of the Blueprint 2020
Footnote

vision of an open and connected government that engages citizens and  partners for the public good, and a modern workplace that makes smart use of  new technologies to improve networking, access to data and customer service.  For example, the Directorate conducted a post-evaluation survey in 2015-16 and  received feedback which will be used to identify opportunities to improve its  effectiveness, efficiency and value for the future.
Measuring performance and  providing evidence for decision making.
Instill  a strengthened culture of measurement, evaluation, and innovation in program  and policy design and delivery.
Improve  the use of evidence and data in program innovation and evaluation.
President of the Treasury Board of Canada’s  mandate
1.2 Branch priorities
The Evaluation  Directorate is part of the Strategic and Service Policy Branch (SSPB), which  brings together expertise and activities to strengthen corporate planning  processes and align strategic, program and operational policy across the  Department, while maintaining connections with regional operations and program  delivery.
The Evaluation Directorate contributes to the Branch’s work  by influencing the improvement of ESDC’s policy, program and service delivery  to better serve Canadians. It does this by delivering high-quality, relevant,  timely and cost-efficient evaluations to support decision-making.
In 2016-17, SSPB branch priorities that will impact the Directorate’s work  include:
Establish  the mandate/functions of a Chief Data Officer and staff the position. Implement  portfolio-wide data governance and develop a data vision and plan.
Enable  innovation and higher performance by creating a conducive environment,  developing skills within the branch, and attracting the necessary talent.
Identify  information and data needs, potential sources, and develop the necessary tools,  partnerships and mechanisms allowing ESDC to maximize the potential benefits of  data, information and knowledge holdings.
1.3 Evaluation strategies
Another important consideration that impacts evaluation  planning is the recognition that each project is different and presents unique  challenges. Developing evaluation strategies for individual projects and  investing more time and resources in the planning and pre-evaluation stages  allows the Evaluation Directorate to better:
Recognize potential challenges, such as the  availability of useful performance information, and explore innovative processes  and methodologies for overcoming challenges;
Calibrate individual evaluations (i.e. evaluating two or more overlapping  programs in one project risk assessment such as evaluating eight  programs in the Labour Branch in six evaluations) to improve timeliness and  produce more relevant evaluation reports that respond to users’ needs;
Reduce duplication of efforts and maximize  cost-effectiveness by involving key partners in the early planning phase of  evaluations, such as continuing collaboration with the Audit Branch within ESDC  to reduce reporting burden and leverage work; and
Engage senior management at the Departmental  Evaluation Committee (DEC) meetings, which supports the Destination 2020’s
Footnote

goal to improve process and empowerment by connecting employees with senior  management. By including senior management in the planning process, evaluation  information can also be more useful and relevant to the decision-making  process.
Post-evaluation survey indicates that:
Evaluation  products and services were rated positively in terms of value and quality.
The  majority (60%) of clients were satisfied with the service provided by  evaluators.
1.4 Role of the departmental  evaluation committee
The DEC serves as an advisory body to the Deputy Minister on  matters relating to the Departmental Evaluation Plan (the Plan), resourcing and final evaluation  reports. It also serves as a decision-making body on other evaluations and  evaluation-related activities of the Department.
Before it is recommended to the Deputy Minister for  approval, the Plan is reviewed by DEC for evaluation coverage, adequacy of  resources allocated to the evaluation function and related performance  measurement activities, and the approach and level of effort to be applied to  individual planned evaluations.
Effective dialogue and feedback throughout the evaluation process through:
Evaluation  Working Groups.
Evaluation  Advisory Committees.
Departmental  Evaluation Committee.
1.5 Departmental evaluation plan, alignment and consultations
In addition to planning individual projects, the Evaluation Directorate  updates the Plan annually to report on its work over the previous year, to  ensure the Department is meeting accountability requirements with regard to  evaluations, and to develop a strategic plan for the evaluation function.
The Plan reflects  the Financial Administration Act and TB Policy  on Evaluation requirements by placing the evaluation planning on a five-year cycle. The  Directorate has also taken steps to better align the planning of evaluations  with the Departmental and Branch integrated planning cycle by producing the  Plan earlier in the fiscal year.
For this year’s Plan, evaluation project descriptions were  completed for 59 projects. These included program description, evaluation  resources, legislative requirements for conducting the evaluation, status of  performance information, evaluation scope and timelines. Evaluators consulted  with programs at the working level during autumn 2015 to complete the  evaluation project descriptions, then, in the spirit of Blueprint 2020,  consulted with senior management on the overall Plan in January to March 2016.  The Evaluation Directorate also took the opportunity to build knowledge and  understanding among program areas of the evaluation function.
As a new initiative this year, the Directorate developed the Planning and  Reporting on Evaluation Projects (PREP) database. PREP is a one-stop shop that  enables more efficient collection and reporting of evaluation information, as  well as easier access for all Department users via the existing SharePoint  site.
The Directorate is making progress to be more responsive to the needs of a  range of users.
Consultations  took place through various committees as well: SSPB DG Weekly, DG Planners  Committee, Labour’s Policy and Program Committee, DG Data Committee.
1.6 Identifying risks and  mitigation strategies
As part of  the evaluation planning process, the Evaluation Directorate performed a risk  assessment to identify and mitigate risks to the Department in terms of  evaluation planning and coverage under the FAA and Policy on Evaluation. Given the high number of evaluation projects  planned for completion in 2017-18 (15) and 2018-19 (15), Evaluation took a  pro-active approach to mitigate the risk that these evaluations would not be  completed on time. Consultations with program areas were held to:
Reschedule evaluations not required under the FAA and Policy on Evaluation, thereby reducing the number of evaluations scheduled  for the next three fiscal years.
Recalibrate evaluations that must be completed  to meet legal and/or policy requirements, thereby ensuring the information is  available when needed to support decision-making. For example, the evaluation  of Old Age Security will be conducted in two phases: the first will ensure all Policy on Evaluation requirements are  met on time, and the second will review additional program elements to provide  information that would be of use to senior management and the program.
Annual report of the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada on the  Privacy Act (December 2015).
“Canadians’ personal  information is regularly collected and used by federal institutions as a matter  of legal necessity and not by individual choice. Often times, this information  is extremely sensitive. As a result, institutions’ duty of care needs to meet  the highest standards”. - Privacy Commissioner of Canada
2. Achievements in 2015-2016
In addition to delivering on its core responsibility of  producing required evaluation reports, the Directorate made significant  progress in the achievement of other goals. This included increasing its  involvement in policy discussions and program development, reporting on the  state of performance within EDSC, and improving the way it measures its own  performance via a new framework.
2.1 Evaluation reports completed in 2015-2016
The following table shows the  seven evaluation reports, covering eight initiatives, completed in 2015-16,  which compares to 12 reports in 2014-15. To ensure the delivery of real-time results, technical reports and  studies related to those evaluations were shared with program areas throughout  the evaluation process. The Directorate has also invested more time and  resources in planning for the increase in new evaluation projects over the next  fiscal years (30 projects over the next 2 years 2017-2019).
In addition to traditional  evaluation reports and related activities, the Evaluation Directorate has  invested more time in advising program colleagues on performance measurement  strategies (performance measurement advice was provided to over 35 programs and  initiatives). This commitment supports the increase demand in the Department to  improve performance measurement information as well as build the Branch’s  capacity to deliver high quality performance measurement advice and services.  In 2015-2016, the Directorate completed five evaluation strategies and eight  evaluability assessments.
Requirements for evaluation:
FAA: Every department shall conduct a review  every five years of the relevance and effectiveness of each ongoing grants and  contribution program for which it is responsible.
TB  Policy on Evaluation: All direct program spending as well as the administrative  aspect of major statutory spending are evaluated every five years.

Building  Aboriginal Support for West Coast Energy Projects Initiative - Skills and  Partnership Fund Review.
Enhancing the usefulness of evaluation work with other activities:
Approximately 30 technical studies were  completed in 2015-16.
Three lessons learned reports were produced in  2015-16.
Six supplemental studies were completed to help  inform the EI Monitoring and Assessment Report to Parliament in 2015-16.
Numerous reports (methodology, technical,  national, P/T level) relating to the LMDAs were done in 2015-16.
2.2 Supporting policy discussions and program improvement
The Evaluation  Directorate provides evidence for both program and policy decisions and  planning and accountability purposes. In addition to evaluation reports, the Directorate influenced policy and program  design through other products in 2015-16, such as:
Roll-up Summaries on Social Partnership Pilot  Projects
Cost-benefit Analysis of Employment Benefits and  Support Measures
Synthesis of Lessons Learned in Learning and  Labour Market Information
What Works for Whom: An Update of the LMDA Cycle  II Evaluation
Of  note, the Evaluation Directorate is also innovating in its application of web  analytics.  As part of the evaluation of  Learning and Labour Market Information disseminated by ESDC, data on the usage  patterns and preferences of Job Bank website users are being analyzed. This  analysis, triangulated with other sources including administrative data,  surveys, interviews and focus groups, will improve the quality, performance and  utility of content provided on the website. This study will be completed in  spring 2017.
Evaluation  also supports policy dialogue through providing strategic advice, including  reviewing policy documents and sharing evaluation evidence to strengthen such  documents. In 2015-16, the Directorate attended approximately 20 policy  discussions and provided input into seven Treasury Board Submissions and three  Memoranda to Cabinet.
As program areas prepared to brief ESDC’s new ministers in  the fall of 2015, Evaluation provided input into briefing materials on, for  example, Labour Market Development Agreements, Literacy and Essential Skills,  and Connecting Canadians with Available Jobs.
The 2015-16 post-evaluation survey indicates that:
The majority of the evaluation report findings  and recommendations were used, or planned to be used, for program improvements.
Close to 90% of respondents indicated that the  results of the evaluation report were delivered in a timely manner and met our  needs in terms of timeliness.
2.3 ESDC performance measurement reporting
As a tool for  monitoring and reporting on program results, performance measurement has  emerged as a priority for the Government of Canada. Within ESDC, all three  Ministers have been mandated to ensure that the Department’s work is informed  by performance measurement, evidence, and feedback from Canadians. Examples of  recent Evaluation Directorate initiatives in this area include:
Annual  report on the state of performance measurement strategies 2014-2015
As required by the TB Directive  on the Evaluation Function, the Evaluation Directorate reports on the state  of performance measurement. Overall, these annual reports concluded that ESDC has made significant  improvements in the last few years, achieving 85% coverage compared to 60% the  previous year. The last report included updates on 47 performance measurement  strategies, of which 28 were complete, two were exempt from the requirement to  have a strategy, and 12 were planned to be completed by 2016. ESDC has made  significant improvements in the area of performance measurement in the last few  years. However, the lack of performance measurement strategies and  information is persistent and causing major challenges for evaluators to  evaluate some programs. Efforts  are continuing to improve performance measurement information so that program  managers have reliable data to manage programs, and evaluators can better  assess the achievement of outcomes.
Innovation  lab session on performance measurement
In October 2015, the Evaluation Directorate, the Corporate  Planning and Management Directorate, and the New Horizons for Seniors Program (NHSP)  co-hosted the “Moving forward towards better Performance Measurement - A  Spotlight on Innovation” event in ESDC’s new Innovation Lab. This successful  event showcased the innovative work that NHSP is undertaking to track  performance against desired outcomes. Participants shared their experiences,  best practices and ideas about how to effectively measure performance and  provide leaders with useful performance information for decision-making. A summary note on key issues  discussed was disseminated via the EvalConnex group on GCconnex.
Evaluation directorate is supporting development of performance measurement  strategy within the department:
Provided advice on over 35 performance  measurement strategies.
Presented at the Canadian Evaluation Society in  Montreal on May 25, 2015 - “What can Evaluation do to Support Performance  Measurement?”, highlighting  the benefits  of early evaluation in program development, and synergies between evaluation  and performance measurement.
2.4 Looking within: Measuring the Evaluation Directorate’s  performance
While a performance measurement strategy is not required for  internal services such as Evaluation, the Directorate chose to develop a  framework for its function in fall 2015. The purpose of this exercise was to  measure and improve the delivery of Evaluation’s activities, support the  neutral assessment of its function, inform decisions to move the function  forward, and better communicate Evaluation’s vision as a provider of results  that empower decision-making. In addition to being closely aligned with  governmental and departmental priorities, the data collected through  Evaluation’s own internal measurement will support the TB evaluation policy  requirement for the Deputy Head to conduct a neutral assessment of the function  every five years. The next assessment will be conducted in 2018.
The strategy is supported by a post-evaluation client survey  which collects feedback from recently evaluated programs on the usefulness and  timeliness of the Directorate’s products and services. To collect data on other  indicators, evaluators enter quantitative and qualitative information into a  newly-created performance data component of the PREP database. Data collected  in 2015-16 and 2016-17 will help the Directorate establish baselines and  determine the most useful and reliable indicators.
The Evaluation Directorate’s performance measurement  framework focuses on four core actions to enhance the evaluation function:
collaborate,  innovate, streamline and strategize.
1. Collaborate
The Evaluation Directorate, by its  nature as an internal service, cannot complete its projects without engaging  partners and stakeholders across ESDC. In 2015-16, the Directorate made  progress in strengthening connections in the following ways:
Disseminating knowledge
and promising practices widely among  external stakeholders through conferences (e.g., presentations at the 2015  Canadian Evaluation Society conference) and sharing technical studies with  provinces and territories.
Seeking input
from clients using surveys (e.g., survey on the  work of the Databank Review Working Group, and on evaluation service to  clients) to improve the Directorate’s performance. Input is also sought from  the wider evaluation community via professional networks, working groups and  EvalConnex to get feedback on innovative projects (e.g., social media pilot  project, Evaluation Directorate performance measurement strategy), to  participate in discussions and share best practices.
Using software technologies
such as SharePoint and the PREP  database to facilitate engagement and dissemination of information across ESDC.
Evaluation presented 3  papers at Statistics Canada’s 2016 International Methodology Symposium:
Using  Administrative Data to Better Inform Policy Development while Cutting Costs.
Estimating the impact of active labour market  programs using administrative data and matching methods.
Estimating  the effects related to the timing of participation in employment assistance  services using rich administrative data.
2. Innovate
To improve effectiveness and  efficiency, the Evaluation Directorate continually challenges traditional ways  of doing business. The Blueprint 2020 vision includes expectations of a modern workplace that makes smart use of new  technologies that improve networking, access to data and customer service.  Recent innovations include:
Developing a web analytics  methodology
for the evaluation of Learning and Labour Market Information. This study, highlighted  earlier as an example of a supporting product, is exploring how to use Google  analytics to develop a portrait of site users and address questions of  relevance and performance. Because the study features the early-stage adoption  of innovative methodologies, the Evaluation Directorate will be well-placed to  pioneer the use of web analytics as a tool to improve ESDC programs.
Providing programs with comprehensive analysis of  administrative data quality.
This informs data collection activities, improves  the quality of evaluations and increases business intelligence (e.g., New  Horizons for Seniors Program, First Nations Job Fund, national long tenure  worker study) without relying on costly surveys.
Demonstrating leadership in the evaluation community
through  a pilot project to develop common indicators for evaluating social outcomes and  impacts. Evaluation is collaborating with ESDC’s Income Security and Social  Development Branch and Skills and Employment Branch on this project.
3. Streamline
The evaluation function is itself subject to  regular reviews through TBS’s Management Accountability Framework assessments  (every three years) and capacity assessment surveys (annually); periodic  reviews from the Office of the Auditor General; and neutral assessments at  least once every five years. In the last few years, these reviews indicated  that ESDC has a strong evaluation function; however, the Directorate continually  seeks more effective and efficient ways of doing business and supporting ESDC  in becoming a higher-performing organization. Streamlining initiatives include:
Conducting more work in-house
in support of the Federal  Government’s priority to reduce spending on external consultants. Producing  more in-sourced evaluations and lessons learned reports reduces the need for  costly surveys, and leads to improved savings and turnaround times.
Calibrating evaluations to increase the timeliness,  cost-effectiveness and usefulness
of evaluation findings. When programs intersect,  the Evaluation Directorate will attempt to bundle them into one evaluation.  Additionally, a single evaluation strategy will be developed for related  programs, as was done in 2015-16 for Occupational Health and Safety Program,  Labour Standards Program, and Occupational Health and Safety Grants.
Making evidence-based decisions
by measuring how the  Directorate meets its objectives. This will be done by creating a monitoring  database to collect concrete evidence on Evaluation’s performance.
Bundling and splitting evaluations when it makes sense.
The Apprenticeships Grants and Skilled Trades  and Apprenticeships Program (Red Seal) are being evaluated together in one  project.
Old Age Security is being evaluated in two  phases to ensure all Policy on Evaluation requirements are met on time while still allowing for a more thorough review of  such a complex program.
4. Strategize
Adopting  a wide-angle view of the planning environment allows the Evaluation Directorate  to develop evaluation and support strategies that are comprehensive and  sustainable. These include:
Integrating
the DEP better into the departmental annual  planning cycle to align Evaluation activities more closely with ESDC’s proposed  approach to Enterprise Planning and Performance. This new approach ensures that  necessary information is available to program areas to support their planning  for the fiscal year ahead.
Building capacity and understanding
of the evaluation  function throughout the Department by holding discussions with program areas on  evaluation projects and on evaluation as a tool for decision making, and by  increasing the usefulness of evaluation products for program managers. In  2015-16, Evaluation staff gave a presentation to the Labour Program management  committee on evaluation plans and evaluability assessments of Labour Program  evaluations.
Demonstrating greater nimbleness
by making technical reports,  short evaluation reports and studies available to various stakeholders within  the department (e.g., Youth Employment Strategy and Targeted Initiative for  Older Workers). Real-time information is provided to better enable programs and  senior management to respond to emerging policy issues.
Filling knowledge gaps
when performance data is not available  for evaluations by using various methods. For example, in 2015-16, the  Directorate provided advice on performance measurement strategies for over 35  programs and initiatives.  Evaluation is  also helping ESDC’s Integrated Framework on Mental Health initiative to develop  a Performance Measurement Strategy.
Following up on management responses to evaluations
through  annual reports to DEC. The Directorate conducts follows up on the  implementation of actions indicated in management responses to evaluation  recommendations. These exercises reinforce implementation, resolve outstanding  items, assess progress and strengthen program area accountability.  Additionally, the information collected is used as business intelligence when  planning future evaluation work.
3. Moving the evaluation function forward in  2016-17
The Evaluation Directorate is working towards strengthening  its influence on policy, program, and service delivery development as well as  enhancing the strategic use of evaluation information in decision making.
3.1 Enhancing efficiency and effectiveness
The  Directorate supports Government of Canada and ESDC priorities in make progress  toward achieving its mandate and vision, and continuing to implement Blueprint 2020 objectives in 2016-17. It  will continue to act on our identified priorities - collaborate, innovate,  strategize and streamline - with a strong emphasis over the coming year in  these specific areas:
Knowledge dissemination
will be one of Evaluation’s  priorities in the upcoming years to communicate the value and usefulness of  evaluation to stakeholders. It is planning to participate more in conferences  and symposiums, and to publish some of our lessons learned and findings. The  Evaluation Directorate will continue to hold discussions, learning series and  workshops (e.g. annual workshops on Social Partnerships Pilot) for policy and  program staff, senior management, external departments and academics.
Using infographics
will be explored to visually represent  evaluation information, data or knowledge, making the material more accessible  and useful to stakeholders.
Continuing to hire
highly qualified junior evaluators,  enhancing experience as well as knowledge through training and participation in  conferences. The Directorate will also continue developing and maintaining  resource tools to capture valuable employee knowledge (e.g. Evaluation and  Professional Practices Guide).
Identifying needs, gaps and options
by conducting an  assessment to streamline data collection instruments for upcoming Labour Market  Information, Service Delivery and Employment Insurance program  evaluations.
3.2 Contributing to performance measurement beyond programs
As part of its commitment to performance measurement,  supporting an open and networked government, and to providing advice on  performance measurement, the Evaluation Directorate has provided feedback on
Internal Audit Services’ performance measurement audit
, planned to begin in  2016-2017. As the Government of Canada’s priorities include performance  measurement and evidence-based policy, this project is well-timed to provide  the Department with information on the practice and culture of performance  measurement within ESDC and to provide a starting point for department-wide  improvements. In addition, the Evaluation Directorate is supporting the  establishment of a Centre of Expertise in Performance Measurement within ESDC.
Representatives from the Evaluation Directorate are also  supporting the work of innovative projects such as the
Canada Pension  Plan-Disability Second Prototype Initiative
, which aims to use information on  applicants already collected by third-party insurers to improve the efficiency  of processing CPPD applications for higher quality service to Canadians.  Evaluation is providing strategic advice on how to monitor performance and  evaluate changes in the quality of service. For the
ESDC Mental Health  Framework Implementation Committee
, it is providing assessment and performance  measurement advisory services.
Major statutory programs in the department:
Employment Insurance
Old Age Security
Canada Pension Plan
3.3 Departmental evaluation schedule for  2016-17 to 2020-21
TBS requires two templates to be completed to monitor  coverage requirements: a five-year evaluation plan, and evaluation coverage of  ongoing grants and contributions (Gs and Cs) required by section 42.1 of the  FAA.
3.3.1 Five-year evaluation schedule (Annex A)
Through this five-year evaluation schedule, ESDC seeks to  ensure that evaluations are conducted on all ongoing direct program spending,  and of all the administrative aspects of major statutory programs which fall  under the TB Policy on Evaluation suite. However, there is some risk  associated with reaching 100% coverage of all three sub-programs under 1.1  “Service Network Supporting Government Departments” within the Strategic  Outcome of “Government-wide service excellence.” As per the Policy, the Evaluation Directorate has  until March  2018 to cover 1.1.1 Government of Canada Telephone General Inquiries  Services and 1.1.3 In-Person Points of Service by evaluation; and until March  2019 in case of 1.1.2 Government of Canada Internet Presence.
In  addition, the Directorate faces a challenge with incomplete performance  measurement information for some programs, which is necessary for high quality  evaluation reports. Multiple initiatives have been introduced to manage this  challenge, such as investing more in the planning and pre-evaluation stages,  developing evaluation strategies, and engaging more in developing performance  measurement strategies.
The plan encompasses 59 evaluation projects planned for  completion from 2016-17 to 2020-21, including those not required by either the  policy or by FAA. Despite being  outside of legislative requirements, these evaluations are crucial to assessing  programs related to important social and economic issues on the Government of  Canada’s policy agenda. Accordingly, the Evaluation Directorate invests  resources and efforts to determine whether Canadians are receiving value for  money and to provide senior management, parliamentarians and citizens with  information for decision-making and accountability purposes.
3.3.2 Evaluation coverage of ongoing grants and contributions programs  (Annex B)
Through its five-year evaluation plan (2016-17 to 2020-21),  ESDC ensures that all ongoing
Footnote

Gs & Cs programs are evaluated. These include 17 ongoing, non‐statutory  (voted) programs. A number of other voted non-ongoing programs will also be  covered by evaluation (e.g., Joint Evaluation of the On Reserve Income  Assistance Reform to inform the renewal process for the First Nations Job  Fund).
3.4 Capacity, resource planning and structures
The Evaluation  Directorate continually assesses the adequacy of its human and financial  resources.  Evaluations are conducted  both in-house and with the assistance of contracted consultants; however, in  light of strategic objectives, internal capacity is being increased.
Organizational structure
The Evaluation Directorate currently consists of 57  employees across three divisions:   Statutory and Gs and Cs Evaluation, Partnership Evaluation and Strategic  Planning and Methodology, and the Office of the Director General.

Human  resources strategy for ESDC’s evaluation function
To enhance and enrich knowledge and experience  acquired through training, the Directorate has strengthened its training strategy. The  identified training goals are to:
Produce more in-house evaluation work;
Expand junior-level positions;
Ensure that the work is produced and managed  efficiently and effectively;
Retain talented employees and
Support employee engagement and mental health to ensure a  healthy, productive workforce.
In support of these  goals, employees are encouraged to participate in relevant conferences and  association events. Directorate-specific events including workshops, all-staff meetings,  and learning/training sessions on emerging evaluation theories, methods and  technologies are also planned and coordinated.
The Evaluation  Directorate has developed and maintains resource tools to capture valuable  employee operational knowledge, including the Guide on Evaluation and  Professional Practices. This guide has become a standard tool for new and  experienced employees alike, and a key resource for supporting employees in  their duties.
Financial resources dedicated to ESDC’s evaluation function
The Departmental Evaluation Plan is based on its initial  budget of $6.48M as summarized below. The Directorate continues its commitment  to seeking cost-effective ways of conducting evaluations and reduce spending on  professional services when cost-effective, despite broadening the scope and  improving on the strategic nature of evaluation.

The term “ongoing program” refers to a program  that will continue or is likely to continue for a period in excess of five  years.  If a program is set to terminate beyond  a five-year period, the Department should consult with the Centre of Excellence  for Evaluation at TBS regarding the requirement to evaluate the program.  The decision will likely involve consultation  with TBS legal services, Program Sector analysts and the Office of the  Comptroller General - Transfer Payment Policy group.
