Introduction
Purpose of the Plan
This rolling 5-year Plan, required under the TBS
Policy  on Results
, describes all planned evaluations to be undertaken by  ESDC from April 2023 to March 2028. In addition to addressing the requirements  of the
Policy on Results
, the Plan is  designed to assist the Deputy Head by ensuring the availability of factual,  neutral, and timely information on the ongoing relevance and performance of the  Department’s programs and services. The information obtained  through evaluations supports evidence-based decision-making and helps inform Canadians  of departmental results. The Plan also helps ensure transparency in the  decision-making process for the evaluation function, highlighting priorities  and coverage decisions.
The Plan is informed by an annual planning exercise that  identifies the timing of individual evaluations based on the requirements of  the
Policy on Results
, departmental  needs, risks, and priorities. The development and implementation of the Departmental  Evaluation Plan includes:
reviewing various  sources of information to identify all mandatory evaluations and assess  coverage of the programs
consulting with  program officials, key internal committees, and the TBS
assessing risk when  determining the timing and order of future evaluations, prioritizing mandatory  evaluations and evaluations that are most likely to inform major policy and  program decisions
validating  prioritization and securing final approval from the Deputy Head
monitoring and  adapting to the changing departmental context and environment
Annex 1
provides more information about the  Evaluation Planning Process.
Departmental context
The mandate of  ESDC is to build a stronger and more inclusive Canada, to support Canadians in  helping them live productive and rewarding lives and improving Canadians’  quality of life.
To that end,  the Department delivers a range of over 50 programs and services that affect  Canadians throughout their lives and across the country. Programs include transfer  payments to provinces and territories and to organizations via grants and  contributions, transfer payments to individuals via statutory programs, and the  administration and enforcement of workplace legislation as well as service  delivery.
The Department’s  portfolio includes: (1) ESDC, (2) the Labour Program, and (3) Service Canada:
ESDC
delivers a range  of programs and services that assist Canadians. For instance, it provides  seniors with basic income security, supports unemployed workers while helping  them return to employment, helps students to finance their post-secondary  education and to transition to the labour market, and assists parents who are  raising young children. The Department also assists persons with disabilities  and their families
The
Labour Program
fosters safe, healthy, fair,  and inclusive work environments and cooperative workplace relations in the  federal jurisdiction
Service Canada
serves  as a single point of access for some of the Government’s largest and most well-known  programs and services. This includes EI, Old Age Security (OAS), Canada Pension  Plan (CPP), the Social Insurance Number, and the Passport Program
ESDC expenditures on programs and services  totalled $193 billion in fiscal year 2021 to 2022. More than 92% of the  departmental spending directly benefited  Canadians through EI, CPP, OAS, the Canada Recovery Benefits, and other statutory  payments in support of students, apprentices, and persons with disabilities.  The Department also delivered various measures to support early learning and  childcare, youth and helped Canadians to gain the foundational skills needed to  succeed in today’s economy.
Footnote

Evaluation Directorate mandate
The Evaluation Directorate is mandated to evaluate the  relevance and performance of departmental programs, policies, initiatives, and  services. The Directorate influences policy and program design and service  delivery through rigorous analysis and evidence presented in evaluation  reports, as well as via technical reports, syntheses, and supplemental studies.  In that context, the Directorate works with program officials and senior  management on the evaluation process through an inclusive approach to  governance (
Annex 2
).
The ESDC Head of Evaluation is  responsible for leading the evaluation function within the Department. Pursuant  to the 2016
Policy on Results
, the ESDC Head of Evaluation has direct  and unimpeded access to the ESDC Deputy Head, when required, for the  performance of his/her responsibilities.
The Evaluation  Directorate supports program officials
at  all stages of the program and policy lifecycle
:
at the
initial stage
, officials use  evaluations to help inform the development of new programs and policies,  including their delivery and approach to service
during
implementation
, officials use  evaluation findings and recommendations to guide adjustments or program renewal
as a program or policy
matures or winds down
, officials can  use evaluations to inform lessons learned for future programs or policies
Lastly, the  Directorate reports on the implementation of management response action plans.  This approach promotes a system of continuous improvement throughout the  program and policy cycle.
Accomplishments in fiscal year 2022 to 2023
From April 2022 to March 2023, the ESDC Performance  Measurement and Evaluation Committee (PMEC) reviewed and approved various  products, including evaluation reports. Evaluation products and services addressed  information needs in the Department and contributed to the improvement of  programs and services.
Supporting evidence-based decisions
Evaluation products and services influenced and  supported evidence-based decision-making. These include:
9

Footnote
2
Sharing knowledge through dissemination and  engagement
In fiscal year 2022  to 2023, the Department continued to disseminate evaluation findings and engage  with partners inside and outside of the federal government. These activities  included sharing evaluation-related knowledge through publications, presentations,  and engagement activities, through several presentations at eight different  national and international conferences and events, including:
4 presentations
at the
Canadian Economic Association
conference and
2 presentations
at  the annual congress of
la Société  canadienne de science économique
focusing on the innovative use of causal  machine learning to capture heterogeneity in the impact of labour market  programs and a new cost-benefit analysis method to estimate and incorporate the  change in public spending on health care due to labour market participation
8 presentations
at the
Canadian Evaluation Society
conference,  covering various topics, including machine learning, accessibility,  co-development approaches for Indigenous program evaluations, cost-benefit  analysis, and evaluation methodologies employed by ESDC in the last year
a presentation to the
Canadian Labour Economics Forum
webinar on the innovative use of  causal machine learning to capture heterogeneous causal impacts of labour  market programs
a panel presentation at the
25th Metropolis Canada Conference
on assessing the  Impacts of Canada’s Temporary Foreign Worker Program on the Canadian Labour  Market
a panel presentation organized by the
Canada  School of Public Service
on analyzing program and policy results using  linked data
The Department also:
collaborated with the  OECD as part of their assessment of
Canada's system of impact evaluation of  active labour market policies
. The
report
was released during an OECD event in June 2022
supported
reconciliation
by working with  Indigenous communities to evaluate through a co-developed model, Indigenous  programs
carried out evaluation activities in partnership with other federal departments and  provincial/territorial governments
strengthened and  broadened its network with the
academic  community
to explore new avenues of knowledge dissemination and collaboration
engaged in
Federal/Provincial/Territorial discussions
on the results of various studies and best practices to design and deliver  programs (for example, Labour Market Partnerships, Research, and Innovation)
The TBS is  currently
reviewing the
Policy on Results,
which has been in  effect since 2016. The Department is supporting this review and provided  insight into it.
Continued efforts to support the  implementation of gender-based analysis plus
In fiscal year  2022 to 2023, the Department pursued innovative evaluation practices to better  estimate the impact of programs and disseminate results to inform decisions.  Many of these practices strengthen the use of GBA Plus. The incorporation of  GBA Plus into evaluations can help identify barriers faced by under-served and  disadvantaged populations to access programs and services, as well as data  gaps.
For example, a  GBA Plus exploratory evaluation study was recently completed on prominent  labour market programs using an innovative causal machine learning method to  better understand the distribution of program impacts on participants and what  works for whom. This method provides insight into how program impacts vary according  to intersecting identity factors. The study confirmed that in the presence of  high-quality data, novel machine learning methods are an effective form of  advanced causal analysis, whereby impacts can be attributed to specific  interventions for specific subgroups of participants. Going forward, the use of  machine learning and complementary qualitative methods in evaluations will be  explored to support the Department’s commitment towards GBA Plus.
Furthermore,  departmental efforts, led by the Chief Data Office, in close collaboration with  Statistics Canada, are paving the way for the integration of administrative  data and complementary survey data from Statistics Canada. The integration of  administrative and survey data is an important development in terms of enabling  the usage of more valuable and relevant policy analysis, research, and  evaluation activities from a GBA Plus perspective. For example, the
Evaluation  of Canada Pension Plan Disability – Reassessment Element
involved the integration  of data from multiple sources including program administration data, the  Canadian Survey on Disability, Canada Revenue Agency tax data, and census data.  This data integration served as the basis for the conduct of regression  analysis to inform key identify factors affecting the capacity of Canada  Pension Plan Disability beneficiaries to return to work.
Relatedly,  data collection strategies to inform evaluations also included conducting virtual expert panels for the
Evaluation  of the Enabling Accessibility Fund
based on a  utilization and equity-focused approach. Three expert panels were held, each of  which focused on a theme relating to accessibility for a specific age group,  including youth, adults, and seniors.
In the area of  survey design, evaluations made use of an Interactive Fact-Finding System to  support at least 4 web-based survey questionnaires and data analyses carried  out in fiscal year 2022 to 2023. The Interactive Fact-Finding System enables  internal web survey platforms to be fully customizable, meet departmental web  accessibility standards, and are fully bilingual. The Department expects to  continue leveraging this internal survey platform over the coming years to  inform evaluation data collection activities.
Evaluation coverage in fiscal year 2022 to 2023
The Department  uses a consultative process to inform decisions on priorities, evidentiary  needs, and timing of future evaluations. This approach prioritizes mandatory  evaluations and evaluations that are most likely to inform major policy and  program decisions.
In fiscal year  2022 to 2023, 9 planned evaluations were completed (see
Table 1
), including those required under the
Financial Administration Act
as well as  the
Policy on Results
Footnote
3
.
In addition, a  3-year summary report was prepared by the Federal Secretariat on Early Learning  and Child Care with the support of the Evaluation Directorate to outline the  results achieved under the Early Learning Child and Care Bilateral Agreements  from fiscal years 2017 to 2018 until 2019 to 2020. This report fulfills the  reporting and evaluation requirements of the 2017 Treasury Board submission.
In  collaboration with program officials, 6 evaluability assessments were developed  in fiscal year 2022 to 2023. These documents outline options for evaluating a  given program or service and contain information on the scope, methodology and  timing of an evaluation project. The Performance  Measurement and Evaluation Committee is responsible for reviewing and approving  these documents.

Evaluation of Canadian Pension Plan - Service Improvement Strategy
March 2023
Evaluation  products continued to support the
Commissioners  for Employers and Workers
at the Canada Employment Insurance Commission by  examining labour market issues and supporting the work of the Monitoring Report  and Advisory Committee. In collaboration with ESDC’s EI Policy Directorate, the  Evaluation Directorate carried out
supplemental  studies
to inform the annual
EI  Monitoring and Assessment Report
.
Consultations
The annual consultation process for this Plan was  carried-out in November 2022 to identify key evaluation priorities, evidentiary  needs, and timing of future evaluations. Consultation participants included  program officials and stakeholders with specialized expertise (for example, the  Head of Performance Measurement, departmental research divisions, the Chief  Data Office, and Internal Audit Services).
The 2022 consultations re-emphasized the need to:
take into  consideration the
capacity constraints
of programs and reduce the burden of the evaluation process
ensure the
complementarity
of oversight activities
carefully review the
timing and scope
of proposed  evaluations to optimize their (for example, audits) usefulness and value
identify
lessons learned
from recently  introduced measures to inform future policy/program design
leverage
linkages
between evaluation and  research activities to inform evaluation projects, particularly in the area of  the service delivery
Using information obtained through the consultations, the Evaluation  Directorate determined the priorities, evidentiary needs, and timing of future  evaluations.
In addition, the consultation sessions facilitated  collaboration among different groups within the Department who are involved  with data management to increase the availability and integration of data  within the Department. The evaluation planning process also included  consultations with Treasury Board Secretariat officials.
Risk assessment
Once mandatory evaluations have been scheduled, the Department  considers additional discretionary evaluations using an analysis of risk, needs  and priorities. The analysis was informed by examining:
program risks (for  example, size of the population affected or targeted by the program, knowledge  gaps with respect to the program)
departmental risks  identified in the Departmental Risk Profile
internal capacity  constraints, such as the availability of staff
This multi-factor and multi-level approach ensures that  evaluators consider the perspectives of key partners and stakeholders and  internal risks. The Department considers key departmental risks, including the  Risk-Based Audit Plan. In situations where audit and evaluation schedules  overlap for the same program, the Evaluation Directorate collaborates with  Internal Audit Services to ensure the complementarity of internal  audit/evaluation activities. This provides a means of efficiently examining  performance and outcomes.
Evaluation operating environment
The Plan includes an analysis of the environment in which  the Evaluation Directorate is operating. This includes the quality and  availability of program data and the impact of the operating context.
The importance of data management to evaluation
Evaluations rely on performance measurement information and  other data to determine the relevance of programs and services, and whether  they deliver value for money. This also includes having access to  administrative data to improve GBA Plus for certain programs.
The ESDC Data Strategy, including the advancement of a  joint ESDC-Statistics Canada Data Strategy, supports the implementation of the  Departmental Evaluation Plan. The Evaluation Directorate works closely with  ESDC’s Chief Data Office to ensure alignment with the strategy and  collaboration on opportunities to maximize the ability to leverage data and  analytics for evaluation purposes.
The Department  Head of Evaluation supports the Department Head of Performance Measurement in  the development of
performance measurement  and data collection practices
across the Department. In particular, ESDC evaluators  advise PMEC, the Head of Performance Measurement and program officials on the  quality of performance information in
Performance  Information Profiles
and its utility in supporting evaluations. The  Profiles outline the performance measurement approach for each of ESDC’s  programs.
There is a  need to improve access to external data sources and continuously improve data  collection and management strategies, in keeping with the principles of
Open Data
. Effective data management  enables improvements in policies,  programs, and service delivery.
Evaluation resources
Resource allocation
To support  the evaluation function in fiscal year 2022 to 2023, the Department allocated  the equivalent to 66 full-time staff for a total salary cost of about $6.3  million. Note that these figures are limited to ESDC Evaluation Directorate and  do not account for resources allocated by other branches in the Department  associated with the conduct of evaluations. To meet short-term capacity  demands, the Department uses flexible staffing approaches, including hiring  students, casual employees, and external experts to fill specific capacity  gaps.
In fiscal  year 2023 to 2024, the total Evaluation budget is forecasted to be lower compared  with fiscal year 2022 to 2023. The forecasted amount for salary expenditures  for fiscal year 2023 to 2024 is $6.1 million, and forecasted operations and  maintenance is $0.37 million. The Department will  continue to plan evaluations with a focus on new and modified programs and  services in addition to undertaking previously planned evaluations  (with priority given to evaluations having a
Financial Administration Act
(FAA) requirement).

Going forward
The Department tentatively plans to complete  12 evaluations in fiscal year 2023 to 2024. In the years ahead, evaluations  will continue to:
rely on a collaborative approach with policy and program  officials
to provide timely evidence  to inform decision-makers
support the Head of Performance
Measurement
towards  improving performance measurement information and provide advice to internal  stakeholders
incorporate innovative methods
to inform the impact of programs on specific sub-groups in  support of the Department’s implementation of GBA Plus
engage experts
to stay  abreast and adopt best practices from other jurisdictions, departments, and  disciplines
collaborate with evaluation practitioners
to strengthen the evaluation function across government
engage with Indigenous organizations and communities
to co-develop evaluations of Indigenous programs in support  of reconciliation
Furthermore,  the scope of several upcoming evaluations will examine temporary changes to  programs brought forward considering COVID-19. This includes planned  evaluations led by ESDC of the Work-Sharing Program and the Youth Employment  and Skills Strategy that are scheduled for completion by fiscal years 2023 to  2024 and 2024 to 2025, respectively.
This document provides a planned evaluation coverage table  in
Annex 3
. The table demonstrates that the Department will meet  coverage requirements mandated by the TBS, the
Policy on Results
, and the
Financial Administration Act.
This is in addition to completing  discretionary evaluations designated as a priority by the Department. Given  the scale and unique objectives of each EI benefit, the EI program will be  subject to more than one evaluation from fiscal years 2023 to 2024 until 2027  to 2028.
Planned  evaluation coverage from fiscal year 2023 to 2024 to fiscal year 2027 to 2028  might be subject to change, given the announcement of a cross-government  program effectiveness review to examine skills training and youth programming.  This review will determine whether improvements can be made to help more  Canadians develop the skills and receive the work experience they need to have  successful careers.
Programs of grants and contributions that do not have a 5-year  average actual expenditure of $5 million or greater per year are not required  to be evaluated every 5 years. These programs include:
Canadian Benefit for  Parents of Young Victims of Crime
Sustainable  Development Goals Funding Program
Skilled Trades and  Apprenticeship Program (Red Seal Program)
Accessible Canada  Initiative
Strategic Engagement  and Research Program
Programs that are temporary are not required to be evaluated  but may be subject to other reviews. These programs include:
Canada Emergency  Response Benefit (CERB)
Canada Recovery  Benefits
Community Workforce  Development Program
Apprenticeship Service
As per the
Directive on Transfer Payments
, the Black-led  Philanthropic Endowment Fund is required to conduct an independent evaluation.
Neutral Assessment
The 2016
Policy on  Results
requires Deputy Heads to be responsible for ensuring that a neutral  assessment of the evaluation function is conducted at least once every 5 years.
The last neutral assessment of the ESDC evaluation function  was conducted in April 2018. It found overall conformance of ESDC’s evaluation  function with the
Policy on Results
.  The 2023 neutral assessment for the Department’s Evaluation function is  underway by an external contractor. The assessment has three areas of focus: 1)  assessing the governance function; 2) evaluating professional practices; and 3)  monitoring and performance reporting of the evaluation function.
