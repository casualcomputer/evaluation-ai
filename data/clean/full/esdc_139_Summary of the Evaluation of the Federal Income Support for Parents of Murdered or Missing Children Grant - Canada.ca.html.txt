Summary of the Evaluation of the Federal Income Support for Parents of Murdered or Missing Children Grant
The Federal  Income Support for Parents of Murdered or Missing Children grant was introduced  in January 2013 to provide income support of $350 per week for up 35 weeks to  parents who take time away from work to cope with the death or disappearance of  their child under the age of 18.
About the Evaluation
The first  evaluation of the grant examined questions pertaining to relevance, usage,  awareness and administrative costs.
It used the  following lines of evidence:
an analysis  of administrative data;
a review of  the literature;
43 key  informant interviews with federal government representatives, police officers and victim support groups.
The grantâ€™s low take up  reflects the low incidence of child murder and disappearance in Canada
Between 11 to 14 parents applied annually, for a total  of 50 applicants, from 2013 to 2016
The grant was received by 29 parents for a total of  $315,350, between 2012/13 and 2016/17
The maximum payable amount of $12,250 over the maximum  number of weeks was received by 16 parents, between 2013 and 2015
On average, grant payments replaced 78% of the lost  weekly earnings of recipients
Key Findings
The evaluation showed that the  grant addresses a need and fills a gap in assistance, especially for family  members of missing children. According to the key  informants interviewed, the following factors may create a barrier to accessing  the grant:
low level of awareness among  both parents and victim support providers;
personal  turmoil experienced by parents;
difficulties  in accessing and understanding information about the grant and in navigating  the application process.
The following eligibility  conditions are seen by key informants as potential barriers to accessing the  grant:
insufficient earnings prevents some of the  potential claimants from meeting the eligibility threshold;
providing evidence the incident is related  to a possible Criminal Code offence;
providing evidence the child was not a  willing party to the crime, and;
age limit of the victim.
