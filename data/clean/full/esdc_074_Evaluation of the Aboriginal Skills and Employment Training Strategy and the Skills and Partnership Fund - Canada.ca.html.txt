Executive summary
This report  presents the findings and conclusions from the summative evaluation of the  Aboriginal Skills and Employment Training Strategy (the strategy) and the Skills and Partnership Fund  (the fund) programs funded by  Employment and Social Development Canada (the department).
For the past 2 decades, the department has played an important role in  the provision of labour market programming for Indigenous people.
The strategy (April 2010 to March 2018) is a  program designed to increase the participation and integration of Indigenous  people with the Canadian labour force. The strategy provided annual funding to Indigenous service delivery  organizations via contribution agreements for up to 5 years, to design and deliver skills  development training and employment supports for Indigenous people.
The fund (April 2010 to Present) is a  demand-driven, project-based contribution program that supports partners’  specific employment goals by funding short-term projects (from 1 to 3 years) contributing to the skills  development, job training, as well as employment supports for Indigenous  People.
Overall,  interventions provided under the strategy and the fund  were found to improve participants’ labour market attachment. Results vary by  type of interventions and participants’ characteristics. There were 4 main findings of the evaluation:
skills development was the most effective  intervention for improving participants’ labour market attachment, regardless  of their Employment Insurance claimant status
employment  assistance services and targeted wage subsidies interventions also showed positive  results, particularly for participants with relatively stronger labour market  attachment
sustainable  partnerships were developed and fostered with Indigenous partners. Still, some  Indigenous Agreement Holders reported concerns about the implications of  administrative reporting on their relationship with the department
the Aboriginal  Human Resources and Development Agreements, predecessors of similar agreements  under the strategy, yielded a  positive social return on investment over a 12-year period (2 years in-program  and 10 years post-participation) when taking into account costs and benefits  for both governments and participants. In particular, from a societal  perspective, interventions’ benefits outweigh their associated costs in less  than 9 years, and in less than 5 years for participants with stronger  attachment to the labour market
There is a high degree of similarity between the strategy  and the fund in terms of the participants, organizations and the types of  interventions provided. Given their respective policy intents, consideration  could be given to conducting a review and analysis of the approach taken to  better differentiate between the strategy and the fund and ensure value for  money.
Based on these findings, the evaluation recommends the  following:
recommendation 1: It is recommended that the department  better leverage data to collaborate with partners to improve the program
recommendation 2: It is recommended that the department  continue to seek improvements in the administration of agreements with  participating Indigenous organizations
Introduction
This summative  evaluation report presents the findings and conclusions regarding the  Employment and Social Development Canada’s (the department) Indigenous labour market programs: The Aboriginal Skills and  Employment Training Strategy (the strategy) and the Skills and Partnership Fund (the fund). It was completed in compliance with  the
Financial  Administration Act
and the Policy  on Results.
To conduct the  incremental impact analysis, the department relied on its Labour Market Data Platform using participants  who initiated an intervention between January 2011 and December 2012. This  period was selected to obtain the most recent results for the strategy and the fund. In particular, the selection of  interventions initiated between January 2011 and December 2012 allows for  assessing their impacts on labour attachment outcomes over a period of at least  3 years following their  completion up to calendar year 2016 (most recent available information).
The cost-benefit  analysis used a cohort of participants who completed their intervention between  January 2003 and December 2005 in order to obtain a complete long-term 10-year  view of the participants’ changes in employment earnings, incidence of employment  and use of income supports.
The specific  methodologies used to assess the programs performance are described in
Annex C
and in the technical report which is  available upon request.
Incremental impacts  for the strategy and the fund are presented by Employment Insurance  claimant stream (active EI claimants, former EI claimants and non EI  claimants). Only for the strategy  were the selected number of participants sufficiently large to support more  granular analyses at the intervention (with the exception of the Skills  Development Apprenticeship and Self-employment interventions) and sub-group  levels (for example men and  women).
Program background
Introduced in 2010,  the strategy and the fund share the same objective of increasing  Indigenous participation in the Canadian labour market. The fund differs from the strategy in terms of its delivery model. The fund is a demand-driven project-based program  geared towards emerging large-scale projects, such as (but not limited to)  natural resource extraction projects that contribute to skills development and  training of Indigenous people.

Chronology of recent indigenous labour market programming
For the past 2 decades, the department has funded Indigenous  organizations to provide labour market programming  to Indigenous people. The latest iteration, the Indigenous Skills and  Employment Training Program, replaced the strategy as of 2019.
The strategy
Aboriginal Human Resources Development Strategy (April 1999 to March 2010)
This program was designed  to help improve the employment opportunities of Indigenous peoples and enable  them to fully participate in the Canadian economy. Financial assistance was  provided to Indigenous organizations to support the costs of human resources  development programs designed and delivered by those organizations to their  Indigenous participants.
Aboriginal Skills and Employment  Training Strategy (April 2010  to March 2018)
This program was  designed to increase the number of Indigenous people employed and integrated  into the Canadian labour force. This program emphasized the development of  demand-driven skills, fostered partnerships with the private sector and other  levels of government and accountability for improved results.
Indigenous Skills and Employment  Training Program (April 2019 to  Present)
The program aims to  help reduce the skills and employment gaps between Indigenous and  non-Indigenous people by providing Indigenous peoples with opportunities to  develop and upgrade skills and attain employment.
The fund
Aboriginal Skills and Training  Strategic Investment Fund (April  2009 to March 2011)
The program  provided funding for short-term, focused initiatives designed to help  Indigenous Canadians obtain specific training.
Aboriginal Skills and Employment  Partnerships Fund (April 2003  to March 2010)
This program was a  nationally managed, opportunity-driven (in other words, focused on identified  job opportunities), targeted Indigenous skills development program designed to  maximize employment for Indigenous people in major economic development  projects.
Skills and Partnership Fund  (April 2010 to present)
The fund is a demand-driven, project-based  contribution program that supports government priorities and partnerships by funding  short-term projects (in other words from 1 to 3 years) contributing to the skills development, training, as well as  employment of Indigenous peoples.
Transitioning  from the Aboriginal Skills and Employment Training Strategy to the Indigenous  Skills and Employment Training Program
The 2018 federal  budget announced the creation of the Indigenous Skills and Employment Training  Program with an investment of $2 billion over 5 years and $408.2 million  ongoing from 2019 to 2028 . It will  replace the Aboriginal Skills and Employment Training Strategy, with the goal  of helping reduce skills and employment gaps between Indigenous and  non-Indigenous People in Canada. Through co-development with Indigenous  organizations, a new distinctions-based approach will be introduced to better  meet the needs of First Nations, Inuit, Métis, and Urban/Non-Affiliated  Indigenous People.
Participants will  have a seamless transition, as there is a high degree of similarity between the  programs in terms of the participant population, delivering organizations and  types of interventions provided. The distinctions-based approach, additional  funding and enhanced administrative flexibilities, will enable First Nations,  Inuit, Métis and Urban/Non-Affiliated Indigenous organizations to design and  deliver labour market strategies that recognize and respond to their unique  needs, as well as support strategic planning and priority setting.
Strategy and fund participants
Funding provided  through the strategy and the fund supported over 80,000 participants  between January 2011 and December 2012.
Most  individuals (75,625 or approximatively 94%) participated in interventions  offered by Indigenous organizations through the strategy
Approximately  6% of participants (or 4,487) were associated with interventions delivered  under the fund
The distribution of  participants by Indigenous Distinction (see
Annex B
for definitions) was roughly similar across  the strategy and fund:
First  Nations with Indian Status made up 79% of Strategy participants and 82% of Fund  participants, while First Nations without Indian Status represented 5% of strategy participants versus 8% of fund participants
Métis  represented 11% of participants in the strategy relative to 4% in the fund, the largest percentage point difference in terms of representation  across programs
Inuit  made up 5% of Strategy participants compared with 8% of Fund participants
Why does the evaluation focus  on the cohorts of participants from 2011 and 2012?
In order to properly evaluate the impact of  the program on participants, it is necessary to have several years of labour  market outcomes after participation to assess the effectiveness of an  intervention.
By using these cohorts, the evaluation can  leverage the most recent tax records available to conduct this analysis (up to  2016).
As such, the analysis can better reflect  what happened following participation and carefully build a comparison group to  control for any economic factors and cohort effects that might be unique to the  reference period.

Strategy and fund participants: Gender, age and education
Among strategy and fund participants:
under both programs, the majority of  participants were men, representing 63% of participants under the fund and 54%  under the strategy
more than half of the participants were 30 years  old or younger
most participants had, at least, a secondary  school diploma at the start of the intervention, but only a few had completed a  post-secondary degree
almost one-third (30% of Strategy participants  and 32% of Fund participants) were supporting one or more dependents

Strategy and fund participants: Employment insurance  claimant status
Due to the  eligibility criteria of EI, claimant status is a good indicator of the degree  of labour market attachment for a participant at the start of an intervention.  These claimant categories are also important for the strategy with respect to the source of  funding for the program.
Non-claimants  made up the majority of participants in both the strategy (69%) and the fund (63%)
Fund  participants were slightly more likely (14%) to be active claimants than were  Strategy participants (10%)
Definitions
Active EI claimants
Have an open EI  benefit claim and are collecting benefits at the start of their intervention.
Former EI claimants
Have no open EI  benefit claim and do not collect benefits at the start of their intervention,  but have received some EI benefits within the 3-year period prior to starting the intervention.
Non EI claimants
Have no open EI  benefit claim and do not collect benefits at the start of their intervention  and have not received any EI benefits within the 3-year period prior to starting the intervention.

The Role of EI in the strategy and the fund
The Aboriginal  Skills and Employment Strategy had 2 sources of funds: The Consolidated Revenue Fund and the EI Operating  Account which funds EI benefits provided under Part I and Part II of the
Employment  Insurance Act
.
Support for the strategy was part of the EI Program’s  Pan-Canadian activities, in which the federal government plays a primary role  in responding to challenges that extend beyond local and regional labour  markets. In fiscal year 2017 to 2018, the EI Operating Account contributed $100.9 million to fund  the employment benefits and support measures delivered to Indigenous active and  former EI claimants through the strategy.
The Skills and  Partnership Fund is funded from the Consolidated Revenue Fund.
Strategy and fund participants: Distribution by location
Geographically, in  line with their delivery model, the distribution of participants by province  and territory under the strategy  and the fund differs  significantly. The strategy  participants are located across Canada whereas the fund participants are located where partners’  projects were located from January 2011 to December 2012.
Along  an urban-rural dimension, based on postal codes (see
Annex B
), participants were almost equally divided  with Fund participants somewhat more likely to be in rural communities than  Strategy participants.

Main finding #1
Overall,  the strategy had a positive impact on participants’ labour market attachment.
Following an  intervention, strategy  participants had increases in employment earnings, incidence of employment and  decreases in reliance on Social Assistance compared to non-participants after  controlling for other factors.
During the 3-year period following an intervention:
active EI  claimants experienced the largest gains in earnings (+$10,920 over 3 years) and incidence of employment (+3.9  percentage points per year)
former EI  claimants experienced the largest decrease in Social Assistance used (-$830  over 3 years)
non EI  claimants, experienced more modest improvements in labour market attachments
Comparison groups
Incremental impacts  compare participant results to the results of a comparison group to learn about  what would have happened in the absence of the program.
Please note that  estimates for former EI claimants and non EI claimants are likely  underestimates as the population pool used to construct the comparison groups  consists of individuals who received low intensity support measures in the form  of employment assistance services (only).
See
Annex C
for more details on the comparison groups.

* Results are statistically not significant, still they are valid in terms of informing the direction of the impact (negative or positive)
Taken as a whole,  interventions provided under the fund were found to improve participants’ labour market attachments.
Overall,  former EI claimants experienced relatively larger improvements compared to  those found for active EI and non-EI claimants. During the 3-year period following their participation,  these interventions led to:
a cumulative increase of $6,010 in earnings
an average annual increase of 5.3 percentage  points in their annual incidence of employment, and
a cumulative decrease of $480 in  post-participation receipt of social assistance benefits
Active  EI claimants experienced similar improvements in post-participation earnings as  those found by former EI claimants, but impact on the incidence of employment  was very small
Non EI  claimants, experienced more modest improvements in their labour market  attachments
Similarity  between the fund  and the strategy
There  is a high degree of similarity between the strategy and the fund  in terms of the participants, organizations and the types of interventions  provided.

Main finding #2
The  strategy’s skills development intervention was the most effective at improving  participants’ labour market attachment.
In addition, Employment  Assistance Services and targeted wage subsidies interventions showed positive  results particularly for participants with relatively stronger labour market  attachment.
This section  presents the incremental impacts on labour market attachments by EI claimant  status. This is done with a view to inform which interventions are more  conducive to improve labour market attachment and for whom.
As  mentioned earlier, EI claimant status is a good indicator of the degree of  labour market attachment for a participant at the start of an  intervention
In terms of  interventions, all Strategy interventions have been compiled into 8 types of interventions available to participants:
Skills  Development
Employment  assistance services
Skills  Development Essential Skills
Student  Work Experience
Job  creation partnership
Targeted  wage subsidies
Skills  Development Apprenticeship
Self-Employment
Since the number of  selected participants was not sufficiently large to allow for this type of  analysis to be conducted for the fund participants, the incremental impact analysis is limited to  interventions provided to the strategy’s  participants.
In  addition, no impact analysis was conducted for the Self-Employment and Skills  Development Apprenticeship interventions since no comparison group could be  built
The impact analysis  focuses on the initial years following an intervention, up to calendar year  2016 (most recent available information).
Determining a participant’s intervention type
A number of  different types of employment benefits and support measures, or interventions,  are available to participants in the strategy. In fact, a participant may undertake multiple types of  interventions as part of their engagement with the strategy. Depending on the participants’  needs and the steps identified to foster their labour market attachment, the  combination of interventions and their sequencing may differ across  individualized action plans (for example the acquisition of essential skills taking place prior to the  acquisition of more specific skills development intervention).
The unit of  analysis used for the assessment of incremental impacts is the Action Plan  Equivalent (APE), which is a group of interventions an individual participated  in within 6 months of each  other (in other words, a gap of 6  months or less between the end of one intervention and the beginning of the  next). The principal intervention is the longest one within an APE.
In particular, the  average number of APEs taken by a participant was 1.17 during the reference  period. In order to classify cases where there were multiple intervention  types, the incremental impact analysis combined all interventions that a  participant received within 6 months  (183 days) and assigned a participant to the longest intervention received. For  those participants who received more than one intervention, incremental impacts  will reflect the interactions between these interventions.
Main takeaways
Across all claimant  categories:
the Skills  Development intervention reached about 41% of the strategy’s participants and were the most  effective at improving participants’ labour market attachment, regardless of  their EI claimant status
the targeted  wage subsidies intervention reached a smaller share of the strategy’s participants (3.9%) but led to  positive results on earnings, incidence of employment and reliance on Social  Assistance, particularly for those with relatively stronger labour market  attachment (in other words, active EI and former EI claimants)
Employment  Assistance Services served just over 31% of all clients. Though results were  only available for active EI claimants, who typically have stronger labour  market attachment, results were positive across all indicators
Active EI claimants category
An
active EI Claimant is an
Individual who has an open EI benefit claim and is collecting benefits  at the start of his/her intervention.
Among participants  in the strategy, active EI  claimants had relatively stronger attachment to the labour market compared to  other participants and represented about 10% of participants.
For  active EI claimants, the incremental impacts were measured relative to a  comparison group of Indigenous active claimants who were eligible to, but did  not, participate in programs and services provided under the strategy or the fund
For this group of  participants, results indicate that the following interventions are conducive  to improvements in the participant’s labour market attachment:
Skills Development
Employment Assistance Services
Targeted wage subsidies
On average, active  claimants who took part in these 3 types of interventions improved their labour market attachment through  increase in earnings, incidence of employment and decrease in their use of  social assistance benefits relative to their counterparts among  non-participants.
On the other hand,  positive labour market impacts were small for active EI claimants who took part  in the Skills Development - Essential Skills, suggesting that this type of  intervention, while necessary, may not have been sufficient to foster stronger  attachment to the labour market.
For active  claimants, improvements in labour market attachment were similar across gender  and urban/rural settings (see
table 9
for more detailed results).
Due to the small  number of EI claimants participating in the
Job creation partnership
and
Student  Work Experience
no  net-impact analysis could be conducted for these interventions

* Results are statistically not significant, still they are valid in terms of informing the direction of the impact (negative or positive)
For example, as  shown in
table 9
, in the 3-year  period following the receipt of
Targeted wage subsidies
by participants, the intervention led to:
a  cumulative increase of $6,560 in employment earnings
an average  annual increase of 6.4 percentage points in the incidence of employment
a  cumulative decrease of $1,180 in receipt of social assistance benefits
Former EI claimants category
A
Former EI Claimant
is an individual who has no open EI  benefit claim and do not collect benefits at the start of his/her intervention,  but has received some EI benefits within the 3-year period prior to starting the intervention
Among participants  in the strategy, former EI  claimants typically had weaker labour market attachments (relative to active EI  claimants) and represented about 21% of participants. In particular, they are  more likely to be underemployed, or out of the labour force for various reasons  or on Social Assistance.
For  former EI claimants, the incremental impacts were measured relative to a  comparison group of Indigenous former claimants who received low intensity  employment services interventions (in other words, Employment Assistance  Services only), but did not participate in the strategy or the fund.
For this group of  participants, results indicate that the following interventions are conducive  to improvements in the participant’s labour market attachment:
Skills  development
Skills development - Essential skills
Targeted wage subsidies
On average, former  EI claimants who took part in one of these 3 types of interventions improved their labour market outcomes through  increases in earnings, incidence of employment and decrease in their use of  social assistance benefits.
On the other hand,  labour market impacts were mixed for those who took part in job creation partnership.  The mix of positive and negative results reflect, in part, the short-term  nature of these interventions and that this intervention generally targets  individuals with multiple barriers and weak labour market attachments.
Among former EI  claimants positive incremental impacts for women and urban participants were  generally larger relative to those found for men and rural participants,  respectively (see
table 10
for more detailed results).
Due to the  selection for the control group, no net-impact analysis could be conducted for
Employment Assistance Services
.
The same applies to
Student Work Experience
due to the small number of former EI claimants using this intervention.

For example, as  shown in

a  cumulative increase of $4,400 in post-participation earnings
an  average annual increase of 5.7 percentage points in the incidence of employment
a  cumulative decrease of $1,300 in post-participation receipt of social  assistance benefits
Non EI claimants category
A
Non EI Claimant
is an individual who does not have an  open EI benefit claim and do not collect benefits at the start of his/her  intervention and also did not receive any EI benefits within the 3-year period prior to starting the  intervention.
Among participants  in the strategy, non EI  claimants typically had the weakest labour market attachments (relative to  active and former EI claimants) and represented about 69% of participants.
For non  EI claimants, the incremental impacts were measured relative to a comparison  group of Indigenous individuals who were neither active nor former claimants at  the start of their intervention, and who received only low intensity employment  services interventions during the same period (in other words, Employment  Assistance Services only).
For this group of  participants, results indicate that the following intervention is conducive to  improvements in the participant’s labour market attachment:
Skills  development
For participants in  Skills Development - Essential Skills and targeted wage subsidies  interventions, small improvements in their labour market attachment were also  found. Still, for targeted wage subsidies, positive impacts found during the  in-program period tended to weaken in the years that followed.
On the other hand,  labour market impacts were mixed for non-EI claimants who took part in job  creation partnership and the Student Work Experience interventions.
For job  creation partnership, the mix of positive and negative impacts reflects, in  part, the short-term nature of these interventions and that those generally  target individuals with multiple barriers and weak labour market attachments.
For  Student Work Experience, the mix of positive and negative impacts results were  expected since students participate in the intervention during their school  breaks and return to school once the intervention is completed.
Among non EI  claimants positive incremental impacts were slightly larger for women relative  to men and for urban participants relative to rural participants, respectively  (see
table 11
for more detailed results).
Due to the  selection for the control group, no net-impact analysis could be conducted for

Main finding #3
The  strategy and the fund developed and fostered sustainable relationships with  Indigenous Agreement Holders.
Still, some Indigenous  Agreement Holders reported concerns about the implications of administrative  reporting on their relationship with the department.
This finding was  developed using 2 complementary  lines of evidence: key informant interviews and a document review
Footnote
1
. The interviews were conducted in May 2019 with 15 department  officials, 5 representatives from other federal government departments  providing funding to Indigenous communities and 25 Agreement Holders comprising  of 10 with the strategy, 6 with the fund and 9 with both programs. In addition,  more than 2,000 program documents were reviewed for a better understanding of  the strategy and the fund. This evidence provided in-depth information  regarding relationships between the federal government and the Agreement  Holders, and the associated administrative and data management system  processes.
Strategy and Fund Indigenous  Agreement Holders developed and maintained sustainable partnerships; however,  some challenges remain regarding the partnerships between the Agreement Holders  and the community organizations.
As required by the fund, Agreement Holders had to maintain  partnerships with a range of organizations that contributed in various ways to  the success of the program. Many Indigenous Agreement Holders also have both  formal and informal partnerships for the strategy interventions.
Agreement Holder  partnerships were established mainly with training and educational  institutions, employers and industries. In addition to providing learning and  employment experience, partners share costs, and provide resources and services  to support the Agreement Holders in program delivery.
Interviewees  reported that potential barriers that hinder creating and maintaining  partnerships within their communities include the remote location of their  communities, administrative delays, discrimination and missing or outdated  labour market information. For instance, Agreement Holders from remote  communities have greater difficulties finding and maintaining stable  partnerships because of the limited number of organizations and the high cost  of providing services in these areas.
Although  mentioned by a few respondents, discrimination is seen as a barrier to  partnerships due to potential partners perceived as not being interested in  working with Indigenous participants.
Administrative burden and  strained relationships with program officials remain despite previous efforts  to make improvements.
The 2015 Strategy  evaluation report identified the technical nature of data requirements, staff  turnover and Departmental reporting requirements as challenges for the Agreement  Holders. As a result, the Evaluation Directorate recommended the streamlining  of data collection processes, including the adoption of consistent and common  data reporting requirements, and the avoidance of reporting overlap and  duplication where feasible. Still, keeping in mind inherent trade-offs between  ensuring good governance (for example accountability) and providing greater flexibility at the agreement  holders’ level, the administrative reporting procedures continue to be viewed  as hindering the Agreement Holders’ ability to meet their obligations.
The department’s staff turnover is a factor  contributing to Agreement Holders’ administrative burden. For example, some  interviewees noted challenges related to knowledge transfer from former to new  program officials, which results in departmental staff being unfamiliar with Agreement Holders’ programming.  In some instances, the interviewees reported that they spent a fair amount of  their time briefing their program official about their specific situation and  past activities. This creates additional work for Agreement Holders, hampering  them from delivering services to their participants.
Some interviewees  also expressed concern over the level of scrutiny they faced from program  officials regarding financial reporting. Interviewees indicated that they are  at times required to provide considerable details for reporting purposes and  justifications concerning their expenses. Staff turnover is, in part,  inadvertently exacerbating this issue. For instance, respondents mentioned that  they are less likely to be scrutinized when the program officials are more  experienced and have knowledge of the programming. As a result, this affects  Agreement Holders’ relationship with program officials.
In regards to  reporting requirements, lack of clear guidelines as well as strict and tight  reporting deadlines affected the Agreement Holders’ capacity to achieve their  intended outcomes. A few interviewees note that the information required for  reporting purposes is significant and results in organizations dedicating  considerable time and resources to reporting.
To mitigate this  issue and improve relationships, interviewees did acknowledge that progress has  been made to alleviate the administrative burden and improve relationships, for  example by:
improved  transition planning to ensure new officers are well-informed and familiar with  Agreement Holders’ activities
timely response  to requests and providing accurate information
consistent  communication from program staff with Agreement Holders along with regular  meetings and site visits
decreased  reporting requirements to allow more focus on program delivery
Indigenous Agreement Holders  and program officials face challenges with the client data management system.
Data management is based  on the exchange of individual level data between the Agreement Holder and the  department. Client case management is conducted at the Agreement Holder level  which consists of the creation of clients' files that are uploaded on a  quarterly basis through the Data Gateway. The department validates the data and returns the files to the Agreement  Holders if there are errors.
Most interviewees  perceived that discrepancies existed between the data inputted by Indigenous  Agreement Holders and what is received by the department. This led to the assumption that data were being lost during  the transfer from the Agreement Holders to the department in the data  management system.
In addition, staff  turnover also exacerbated challenges related to the data management system.  Interviewees noted that the department  may not be familiar with the case management systems being used by the  Agreement Holders to collect data. As well, few interviewees explained that  some of the reporting challenges may be attributable to data entry issues on  their end, potentially speaking to insufficient capacity and training.
Promising practices  to mitigate these challenges include:
developing  their own data management system, as was done by a few Agreement Holders, to  better fulfill their own data needs as well as reporting requirements as set  out under their agreement, and also to keep a track record in instances of data  discrepancies. However, considering financial and capacity limitations, it is  recognized that this may not be possible for all Agreement Holders
increasing  training opportunities (in the form of webinars or seminars) for Agreement  Holders and Department staff, especially at the onset of their projects, to  increase awareness of the tools being used to report data
creating  tools to help Indigenous organizations to enter data, as was done by some of  the program officials. This not only supports Indigenous Agreement Holders, but  also helps avoid data entry errors
Main finding #4
The  Aboriginal Human Resources and Development Agreements, predecessors of similar  agreements under the strategy, yielded a positive return on investment over the  10-year post-program period for individuals and society as a whole.
The incremental  impact analysis, presented earlier, assesses the effectiveness of interventions  focusing on the first 3 years  following an intervention (up to 2016). As a result, this type of analysis does  not inform the longer-term impacts on participants that such interventions may  have.
Taking advantage of  the fact that there is a high degree of similarity between existing and  predecessor programs in terms of the target population, the delivering  organizations and the types of interventions provided (see
Annex E
); a longer-term cost-benefit analysis was  conducted. To conduct the cost-benefit analysis, the department relied on its Labour Market Data  Platform using participants who completed their intervention between January  2003 and December 2005. As per the incremental impacts presented under finding  #2, a cost-benefit analysis is presented by EI claimant status.
This analysis  examined labour market outcomes 3  years prior to participation in the intervention and for 2 years during participation. The analysis  then continued to observe the labour market attachment for 10 years after the participants had completed  their intervention relative to that which was observed for a comparison group.  The cost-benefit analysis reports on the net present value and the cost-benefit  ratio from the perspectives of the individual, the government and the society.
From  the government’s perspective, costs are incurred up-front and consist of  program costs. On the other hand, benefits accrue over time in the form of  increased taxed revenues and decreased outlays from support programs (for  example social assistance)
From  the individual’s perspective, benefits accrue over time and take the form of  higher earnings and improved social outcomes
From a  society’s perspective, the total net benefits of both the government’s and the  individual’s perspectives are taken into account (government + individual)
On this basis, the  number of years necessary for the accrued benefits to equal the up-front costs,  as well as the rate of return, (hereafter referred to as ‘break-even’) can be  estimated.
Lastly, the  cost-benefit analysis reflects the tax treatment of employment income earned by  a Status Indian on reserve. This translates into subsequent lower benefits to  the government and higher benefits to individuals.
Cost-benefit analysis: Other intangible benefits
The  cost-benefit analysis is based on main quantifiable costs and benefits.  Therefore, it does not include intangible benefits such as higher well-being  for individuals associated with better health outcomes and reduced criminality.  For instance, in addition to producing improvements in labour market  indicators, it is likely that active labour market programming such as the strategy have positive influences on  additional social outcomes such as health and crime. According to  research-based evidence, labour market participation and higher income is  associated with better health outcomes (see Canadian Institute for Health  Information, 2015; Saunders and  al., 2017) and lower risk of criminal activity (see Nilsson & Agell, 2003;  Machin and Meghir, 2000)
Therefore,  expanding the cost-benefit framework to include potential savings resulting  from improved health outcomes (in other words, reduced health system  expenditures) and decreases in criminal justice system contact (in other words,  reductions in the costs of policing, courts, and correctional services) could  yield additional positive impacts for both individuals and the government  beyond what is directly measured
Interpreting results from the cost-benefit analysis presented by EI claimant category
Caution should be  exercised in comparing cost-benefit analysis results across different EI  claimant categories. In particular, for each EI claimant category, a unique  comparison group was built to reflect the set of observable characteristics of  their respective participants at the time. In addition, results reflect the mix  of interventions received and examined under each EI claimant category. More  detailed information on the methodology used to conduct the cost-benefit  analysis can be found in the Methodology Technical Report, which is available  upon request.
Active EI claimant category
The total social  benefit (governments + individual) is $3,519, yielding a social return on  investment of 45% over 12 years (2 years in-program and 10 years  post-participation).
For  individual participants, the total net benefit is $10,425
On the  other hand, the total net cost for governments is $6,906
Overall, from a  societal perspective, the interventions “break even” in 4.5 years after  participation.

Conclusions
Overall, the  analysis determined that improving labour market attachment of participating  Indigenous peoples is attributable to both the strategy and the fund.
Skills  development was the most effective intervention for improving participants’  labour market attachment, regardless of their EI claimant status
Employment  Assistance Services and targeted wage subsidy interventions also showed  positive results particularly for participants with relatively stronger labour  market attachment
Sustainable  partnerships were developed and fostered with Indigenous partners. Still, some  Indigenous Agreement Holders reported concerns about the implications of  administrative reporting on their relationship with the department
The  Aboriginal Human Resources and Development Agreements, predecessors of similar  agreements under the strategy,  yielded a positive social return on investment over the 10-year post-program  period when taking into account costs and benefits for both the government and  participants
Findings of this  evaluation are consistent with those of labour market programing, evaluated in  2009 and again in 2015. Specifically, the 2015 evaluation showed positive  short-term trends in the labour market outcomes of program participants. Also,  it confirmed that program data can effectively support the estimation of  incremental impacts (using comparison groups).
Moreover, the  previous evaluations found a sustained increase in employment incidence and  annual employment earnings as well as a decrease in dependence on EI benefits  or Social Assistance.
The key 2009  evaluation results are described in detail in
Annex E
.
Recommendations
Based on the  impacts discussed within this evaluation, the strategy and the fund  interventions are generally helping participants to improve their labour market  attachment after participation. Moreover, the social benefits of participating  in the interventions exceed the cost of investment for all EI claimant  categories (active participants, former and non-claimants) over time. Key  informant interviews and the document review also provided insight into the  relationship between the department and the Indigenous Agreement Holders.
However,  information available on the fund’s  participants was not sufficient to support an in-depth analysis either at the  intervention or socio-demographic level. There is a high degree of similarity  between the strategy and the fund in terms of the participants,  organizations and the types of interventions provided. Given their respective  policy intents, consideration could be given to conduct a review and analysis  of the approach taken to better differentiate between the strategy and the fund and ensure value for money.
Recommendation  #1
:
It is  recommended that the department better leverage data to collaborate with  partners to improve the program.
Recommendation  #2
:
It is  recommended that the department continue to seek improvements in the  administration of agreements with participating Indigenous organizations.
Management response and Action plan
Recommendation  #1
It is recommended that the department better leverage data  to collaborate with partners to improve the program.
Management response
Management agrees  with the recommendation.
In April 2019, ESDC  formally launched the Indigenous Skills and Employment Training (ISET) program  to replace the strategy. The  design of the new program has been informed by engagement with Indigenous  partners to ensure it responds to the unique needs, circumstances and  aspirations of Indigenous communities across Canada. Key components of the new  program include enhanced training and resources to strengthen program delivery  and data quality and collection; co-development of performance frameworks;  longer term and more flexible funding arrangements; and provision of analysis  of program data and labour market information to support Indigenous  organizations.
As part of implementation  of the new program, the department is working closely with Indigenous  contribution recipients to co-develop performance indicators for the ISET  program that maximize the use of program data and enhance analysis and linkages  to other data sources to demonstrate outcomes.
The department is  also working with Indigenous partners to improve and share analysis of program  data to better respond to distinctions-based priorities of recipients and  inform program delivery.
The department will  review and refine data collection for the Skills and Partnership Fund to  support future analysis and improve management of the program.
Actions planned and anticipated completion date
1.1 Implement  enhanced training on ISET program data collection and data quality (anticipated  completion date: March 2019)
1.2 Commence  collection of ISET program data (anticipated completion date: June 2019)
1.3 Review  process and elements for Skills and Partnership Fund data collection  (anticipated completion date: Fall 2020)
1.4 Provide  analysis of ISET program data to aid in program delivery by distinction  (anticipated completion date: Fall 2020)
1.5 Provide  recommendations for ISET program performance indicators using program data and  other sources (anticipated completion date: Spring 2021)
Recommendation  #2
It is recommended that the department continue to seek improvements in the administration of  agreements with participating Indigenous organizations.
Management response
Management agrees with the recommendation.
In April 2019, ESDC  formally launched the Indigenous Skills and Employment Training (ISET) program  to replace the strategy. The  design of the new program has been informed by engagement with Indigenous  partners to ensure it responds to the unique needs, circumstances and aspirations  of Indigenous communities across Canada. Notably, ESDC has adopted a  results-based approach to agreement management, shifting the focus from direct  oversight of expenditures to an emphasis on outcomes achieved for  beneficiaries.  ESDC is continuing to  actively co-develop the implementation of the ISET program with Indigenous  partners.
As a result, the  ISET program contains a number of measures that were co-developed to improve  the administration and implementation of agreements. For instance, the revised  program terms and conditions provide greater flexibility to align eligible  expenditures with necessary client support, targeted interventions and training  needed for overall success of the program.   Also, the ISET agreements incorporated greater flexibilities and reduced  administrative burden for recipients including flat rates for reimbursement of  administrative expenditures.
The introduction of  the capacity assessment model to assess, manage and mitigate risks associated  with the implementation of ISET agreements is another measure that improves the  overall program responsiveness.  An  organizational capacity assessment is a joint process that aims to understand  an organization’s ability to deliver services and determine the level of  support it requires to achieve program results.   Under this approach, monitoring frequency and reporting requirements are  adjusted based on the results of the capacity assessment allowing ESDC to shift  the focus to improving Indigenous organizations’ capacity rather than direct  administrative oversight.
As a means to  continuously improve the administration of the program, ESDC has launched an  ISET Program Implementation Working Group for each distinction. Specifically,  these Indigenous co-led groups are tasked with reviewing ISET implementation  elements to identify areas for improvement. The ongoing dialogue and  collaborative approach also facilitate the implementation of future measures  identified by the Working Groups.
The new measures  implemented under the ISET program, and future ones that might arise from the  ISET Program Implementation Working Groups, foster continuous improvements in  the effectiveness and success of agreements. This co-development approach  embedded in the ISET program will improve ESDC’s relationship with Indigenous  organizations.
Improvements  resulting from this new approach will be applied to the Skills and Partnerships  Fund as appropriate.
Actions planned and anticipated completion date
2.1 In  collaboration with Indigenous partners, develop new financial and  administrative reporting requirements for inclusion in new ISET agreements  (anticipated completion date: January 2019)
2.2 Ensure  program implementation is co-developed through direct engagement with  Indigenous partners (anticipated completion date: April 2019)
2.3 Adopt a  results-based approach for agreement management and expand allowable  expenditures to enable Indigenous organizations to more effectively shape  interventions to meet client needs (anticipated completion date: April 2019)
2.4 Introduce  a new risk assessment model and streamlined reporting requirements based on the  organizational capacity of Agreement Holders (anticipated completion date:  April 2019)
2.5 Put in  place distinction-based Program Implementation Working Groups (anticipated  completion date: June 2019)

of Canada), and/or those who have membership in a First  Nation or Indian band. Indigenous peoples of Canada are defined in the
Constitution  Act
, 1982, Section 35 (2) as including the Indian, Inuit and  Métis peoples of Canada.

For the purpose of this evaluation, First Nations peoples  have been divided into status and non-status groups to provide results from  both groups separately.
Employment Insurance claimant status
Active EI claimants
Individuals who have an open EI benefit claim and are  collecting benefits at the start of their intervention.
Former EI claimants
Individuals who have no open EI benefit claim and do not  collect benefits at the start of their intervention, but have received some EI  benefits within the 3 year period prior to starting the intervention.
Non EI claimants
Individuals who have no open EI benefit claim and do not  collect benefits at the start of their intervention and have not received any  EI benefits within the 3-year period prior to starting the intervention.
Action plan equivalent
The unit of analysis used for the assessment of incremental  impacts was the Action Plan Equivalent (APE), which is a group of interventions  an individual participated in within of 6 months of each other (in other words,  gap of 6 months or less between the end of one intervention and the beginning  of the next). The principal intervention is the longest one within an APE.
Annex C: Evaluation approach
Lines of evidence and Methodology
Administrative data and Incremental impact methodology
To assess incremental impact, the outcomes of Indigenous  participants (treatment group) who participated in an intervention during the  reference period of January 2011 and December 2012 are compared to Indigenous  individuals who were eligible but did not participate or received a limited  support measure (comparison group).
Performance was measured using 7 outcome indicators:
probability of employment
aggregate employment earnings
weeks in receipt of employment insurance  benefits
amount of employment insurance benefits received
amount of Social Assistance benefits received
incidence of Social Assistance use
reliance on income support
The administrative data used to measure the effect of the  program for participants on key outcomes consisted of linking together the 3 following  data sources (with personal identifiers removed to protect privacy and  confidentiality):
the client administrative data, consisting of  socio-demographic and labour market intervention type and duration related  variables
Employment Insurance Part 1 and Part 2 data, and
Canada Revenue Agency T1 and T4 data
The comparison group for active EI claimants consisted of  non-participants who had an open EI claim. As for former and non EI claimants,  it consisted of individuals under the Labour Market Development Agreement who  received a limited support measure in the form of Employment Assistance  Services.
Limitations and constraints:
the incremental impacts of the former and non EI  claimant participants should be considered as being underestimated. The  incremental impact analysis approach used is based on the difference between  participating in the strategy and the fund compared to participating in low  intensity services (Employment Assistance Services) rather than being compared  to those not receiving any services
the findings can only be reported on a calendar  year basis mainly due to the structure of the Canada Revenue Agency T1 and T4 data.  In addition, it is not possible to identify whether the participant has  full-time or part-time employment
the definition of the pre- and  post-participation period varies depending on the intervention and its  duration. Participants may begin a labour market intervention in one calendar  year and complete it in the next. The post-participation period, therefore,  begins in the first full calendar year following the year the intervention was  completed. This allows for 3 years of post-program observations
Cost-benefit analysis
The reference period for the cost-benefit analysis consists  of participants who completed their intervention between January 2003 and  December 2005. This analysis examined labour market outcomes 3 years prior to  participation in the intervention and for 2 years during participation. The  analysis then continued to observe the labour market outcomes for 10 years  after the participants had completed their intervention.
The cost-benefit analysis reports on the net present value  and the cost-benefit ratio from the individual, the government and the society  perspectives (individual + government).
An accounting framework determined who bore a particular  cost or benefit. All benefits were discounted (by a rate of 5%) after the  participation start year.
Limitations: The cost-benefit analysis is based on major  quantifiable costs and benefits available in the administrative database and EI  Monitoring and Assessment Report. It does not include intangible benefits such  as higher well-being for individuals related to better health outcomes and  reduced criminality.
In addition to producing improvements in labour market  indicators, it is likely that active labour market programming such as the strategy  also has positive influences on additional social outcomes such as health and  crime. According to research evidence, labour market participation and higher  income is associated with better health outcomes (for example Canadian  Institute for Health Information, 2015; Saunders & al. 2017) and lower risk  of criminal activity (for example Nilsson & Agell, 2003; Machin &  Meghir, 2000). Therefore, expanding the cost-benefit framework to include  potential savings resulting from improved health outcomes (reduced health  system expenditures) and decreases in criminal justice system contact  (reductions in the costs of policing, courts and correctional services) could  yield additional positive impacts for both individuals and the government  beyond what is directly measured.
Document review
Over 2,000 documents, including program documents from the  Office of the Auditor General audit and from the 2014 and 2017 engagement  discussions provided context for the delivery of the strategy and the fund.
Key informant interviews n=45
Key informant interviews were conducted in-house (n=20) with:
ESDC and Service Canada officials (n=15) from  national headquarters (n=4) and the regions (n=11)
other departments officials (n=5)
As well, an external consultant conducted interviews with  Indigenous Agreement Holders (n=25). There were 3 types of Agreement Holders:  those that held either a Fund agreement (n=6), a Strategy agreement (n=10) or  both a Strategy and a Fund agreement (n=9).
Limitations: The responses from interviewees represent their  own perspectives and may not be representative of all stakeholders.

Annex E: Key incremental impact results from previous  indigenous labour market programming evaluations
The Aboriginal Human Resources Development Strategy 2009 evaluation
The Aboriginal Human Resources Development Strategy was  designed to help improve the employment opportunities of Indigenous people  (First Nations, Inuit, and Métis as well as status and non-status Indigenous  people living off-reserve), and to enable them to participate fully in the  Canadian economy.
The following describes the results achieved by clients who  received at least one intervention between April 1999 and December 2004.
Active EI claimants experienced an increase in employment  earnings (relative to the comparison group) and in the incidence of employment,  and declines in EI and social assistance benefits received and in reliance on  government income support. Impacts on employment earnings and the incidence of  employment were positive for all programs and services with the exception of  the self-employment program.
For former EI claimants, participation led to a higher  incidence of employment, but lower earnings. Lower amounts of EI benefits  immediately after participation were offset by higher amounts received in year 3.  There was a reduction in social assistance benefits in year 2 and an increase  in reliance on government income support in year 3. The targeted wage subsidies  program exhibited the only positive impact on employment earnings.
Non EI claimants experienced an increase in employment  earnings and in the incidence of employment. Participants increased their use  of EI in the 3 years post-program and decreased their use of social assistance  and an overall decrease in their reliance on government income support.  The increase in EI use in the post-program  period reflects an increase in EI eligibility based on post-program employment  activities. Skills development, targeted wage subsidies and Employment  Assistance Services had positive impacts on employment earnings and on the  incidence of employment.
Skills development increased the incidence of employment and  earnings for Active EI clients and non EI eligible clients and reduced their  use of Social Assistance and dependence on government income support. Non EI  eligible clients increased their EI use in the full post-program period,  reflecting an increased EI eligibility based on post-program employment  activities. Former EI claimants experienced an increased incidence of  employment but lower earnings and mixed results for EI benefits and dependence  on income support.
Targeted wage subsidies increased the incidence of  employment and earnings for all participants. Former EI clients and non EI  eligible clients increased their EI use through insurable earnings and reduced  the use of Social Assistance.
Self-employment participation resulted in a decline in the  incidence of employment and earnings for Active and Former EI clients.
Participation in job creation partnerships increased the  employment earnings for Active EI claimants only. There was also an increase in  the incidence of employment for all client groups. Former EI clients and non EI  eligible clients increased their EI use and reduced the use of social  assistance.
Employment Assistance Services increased the incidence of  employment in the short term and employment earnings for Active EI clients and  non EI eligible clients.
The Aboriginal Skills and Employment Partnership (ASEP) 2013 evaluation
The Aboriginal Skills and Employment Partnership program was  a nationally managed, opportunity-driven (in other words, focused on identified  job opportunities), targeted Indigenous skills development program. It was  designed to maximize employment for Indigenous people in major economic  development projects in industries such as mining, construction, fisheries,  tourism, oil and gas, forestry, hydro and public infrastructure projects across  Canada through a collaborative partnership approach.
The following describes the results achieved by clients  served under 9 ASEP projects funded in 2003 and who ended their participation  by December 31, 2007.
Results from the incremental impact analysis show that ASEP  was effective at increasing the employment earnings of participants over the 4-year  period following the start of their participation. The cumulative incremental  gains in employment earnings were in the $3,600 to $5,200 range. These  incremental earning gains were higher for participants in projects with a  site/industrial project focus (for example ASEP projects focusing on a specific  industrial development such as a mine) than for participants in projects with a  broader industry focus (for example ASEP projects focusing on an industry such  as construction or forestry). The cumulative incremental gain for ASEP projects  with strong focus on a specific industrial development project was $8,500  compared to a statistically non-significant cumulative net gain of $700 for  projects with a focus on a broader industry.
ASEP also had positive impacts on the incidence of  employment of participants. Annual increases of 4.0, 3.0, and 2.5 percentage  points were respectively found in the 3 years following the participation start  year.
ASEP participants increased their use of EI benefits by $650  in the third year following the participation start year. Estimates for all  other years were statistically non-significant. Similarly, none of the impacts  on use of social assistance were statistically significant.
