About the program
The New Horizons for Seniors Program provides $50 million annually in grant and contribution funding to projects that enhance the quality of life and promote the full participation of seniors in Canadian society.
The Program provides funding through 2 funding streams. Through the Community-based funding stream, the Program provides up to $25,000 per project to help seniors in areas such as social isolation, elder abuse, and mentorship. Through the Pan-Canadian funding stream, the Program supports projects using collaborative approaches to address senior issues. Since 2015, the Program has been providing multi-year funding to a group of organizations that work together to achieve common goals, called Collective Impact Initiatives. The first cohort of these projects focused on addressing social isolation with funding of up to $750,000.
