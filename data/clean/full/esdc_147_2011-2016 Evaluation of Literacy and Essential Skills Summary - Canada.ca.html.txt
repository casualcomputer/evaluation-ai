The Program is working with partners and stakeholders across Canada to improve literacy and essential skills by supporting the integration of these skills into labour market programming.
The Program provides:
Grants and contributions to organizations
Tools and resources
Support for stakeholder network development
The Program is making a contribution:
A majority of stakeholders and partners agreed that workplace literacy and skills investments result in more productive workers
Over four-fifths (84%) of funded organizations agreed that the federal government should support efforts in workplace literacy and essential skills
Program increased partner and stakeholder capacity to integrate literacy and essential skills by:
developing and disseminating 88 tools and resources
better collaboration with partners in over 200 engagements
providing over $90M to organizations between 2011 to 2012 and 2015 to 2016
Challenges:
Over four-fifths (82%) of funded organizations indicated a high level of administrative burden
Almost half (48%) of funded organizations stated that changes to the labour market as a whole are not yet evident
Limits to reporting on outcomes due to inconsistency in quality and type of performance information
Recommendations:
Work with partners to develop better partnership strategies that support stakeholder network development and sustainable approaches
Continue to improve communications with partners and stakeholders
Update the performance measurement information and related tools
