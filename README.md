# evaluation-ai
Open repository of codes to train language models for program evaluations.

1. Find data sources (scrape reports from various government departments)
2. Define NLP tasks of interest
   - extraction/summarization of recommendations from all program evaluation reports across departments
   - cluster similar recommendations
   - train a generative language model with LSTM, GRU, and transfromers
